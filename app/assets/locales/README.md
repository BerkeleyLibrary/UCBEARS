# app/assets/locales

This directory contains the following file, copied
from [`mirador_rails-e021335dba4c/vendor/assets/locales/en/translation.json`](https://github.com/sul-dlss/mirador_rails/blob/e021335dba4c25a86259c1b4b958427f6d4d3f88/vendor/assets/locales/en/translation.json),
since we use `en-US` and the `mirador-rails` locale lookup mechanism
doesn't know how to fall back to `en`.
