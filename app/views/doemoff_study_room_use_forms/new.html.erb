  <h2>Borrowing Guidelines</h2>

<p></p>

  <ul>
    <li>The current academic year Doe/Moffitt Study Room/Studio Use Agreement Form must be signed electronically or in person prior to borrowing a study room key for any and all Moffitt Library and Gardner Main Stacks study rooms.</li>
    <li>Study room use requires a reservation (in advance or walk-up) and is limited to current UC Berkeley students, faculty, staff, and post-docs/visiting scholars; users must check out the key and claim their reservation in order to use the room.</li>
    <li>Advance reservations must be made online at <a href="https://berkeley.libcal.com" target="_blank">berkeley.libcal.com</a>; each individual user is permitted up to two hours per day (a day is defined as from 12:00:01 a.m. - 11:59 p.m.) booked in advance using a valid UC Berkeley email address.</li>
    <li>Reserved rooms must be claimed within the first 15 minutes of the reservation. Otherwise, the reservation is forfeited and the room will be made available to others for the entire duration of the booking.</li>
    <li>If availability permits, individuals and groups may inquire at the Doe circulation desk or Moffitt 4th floor service desk about room availability; walk-up reservations are granted only for the current hour on an hour-by-hour basis, and keys are due back at :50 of the present hour.</li>
    <li>Users must vacate the room at or before the reservation end time; rooms should be left neat and free of trash and/or personal belongings, and users/groups must abide by posted occupancy limits; chairs are not to be removed from the room. Moffitt doors must be locked before returning the key.</li>
    <li>There is absolutely NO food/drink permitted in the Gardner Main Stacks and its study rooms.</li>
    <li>Any reservation not claimed within the first 15 minutes will be made available to others for the entire duration of the booking.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Fines and Liability</h2>

<p></p>

  <ul>
    <li>Reservations end at :50 of the last hour of the reservation; the key/pager must be returned to the correct circulation/service desk by the end of the hour to avoid penalties. Tardiness in vacating rooms, returning keys, and other poor room use etiquette (judged at library staff discretion) may result in a temporary block from study room use in both Moffitt Library and Gardner Main Stacks rooms.</li>
    <li>Misuse of keys/study spaces including, but not limited to, keeping a key beyond the start of the hour immediately following a reservation end time, keeping a key after attempts by library staff to page keys and/or contact users, vandalism/damage to library property/study spaces, and removing keys/pagers from library premises, may result in a temporary loss of room use privileges.</li>
    <li>If the pager OR key (one or the other alone) is broken/lost/stolen the replacement charge is $160.00; if the key and pager are both broken/lost/stolen the replacement charge is $310.00.</li>
    <li>Misconduct regarding the reservation and/or usage of Doe/Moffitt study rooms may result in an immediate temporary or permanent block or ban from Doe/Moffitt study room use and potential referral to the Center for Student Conduct.</li>
  </ul>
