# Handle user sessions and omniauth (CAS) callbacks
#
# When a user attempts to access a restricted resource, we redirect them (via
# an {ErrorHandling} hook) to the #new action. This sets the return url, if
# it's known, and forwards them on to Calnet for authentication. Calnet
# returns them (via Omniauth) to the #callback method, which stores their
# info into the session.
#
# The nitty gritty of Calnet authentication is handled mostly by Omniauth.
#
# @see https://github.com/omniauth/omniauth
class SessionsController < ApplicationController
  # Redirect the user to Calnet for authentication
  def new
    redirect_args = { origin: params[:url] || index_path }.to_query
    redirect_to "/auth/calnet?#{redirect_args}"
  end

  # Generate a new user session using data returned from a valid Calnet login

                   omniauth: auth_params
