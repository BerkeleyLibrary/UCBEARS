Financial support for the book\ncame from a Keele University Research Award which gave me time\nfree of teaching to begin work on the first draft. Research awards from\nthe small grant schemes of the British Academy and the Nuffield\nFoundation, although made for an allied project, must be acknowledg-\ned as this archival research support inevitably fed into the content of\nthis book too. Special thanks go to my colleagues at Keele, Malcolm\nCrook, an entirely selfless Head of Department, and Ann Hughes who\nread the entire manuscript as representatives of the intended\nundergraduate readership. Mark Roseman\u2019s contribution was a reliable,\nif not reliably funny, supply of jokes that lifted my spirits when studying\nthe history of Europe in depression threatened to depress me too.\nRichard Overy gave a detailed and insightful commentary on the text.\nHe did his best to save me from errors and some very convoluted prose.\nHis scholarly and personal support have been invaluable. I have also\nbenefited from discussing some of the issues raised herein with Susan\nBrewer, Larry Butler and Harold James who, with characteristic\nkindness, invited me to participate in a fascinating conference, \u2018The\nInterwar Depression in International Context\u2019, hosted by the Bavarian\nHistorical Academy in May 1999. My thanks also go to Conan Fischer\nwho generously shared with me some of his new research into the Ruhr\noccupation. Jeremy Black and Terka Bagley provided important\neditorial assistance and successfully shepherded the book to\nproduction. My final and greatest debt is to my husband Andrew for\nhis unfailing patience, encouragement and good humour. This book\nis dedicated to him.\n\nviii\n''"

The\nscale of economic and social disruption was remarkable. In the worst\naffected European countries \u2014 Poland, Germany and Austria \u2014 one in\nfive of the adult population was unemployed, and industrial output\nhad fallen by 40 per cent in three years. Although there were national\nvariations, no part or Europe was left untouched. At its lowest point,\nthe economic collapse saw levels of European trade fall to one-third\nof its value in 1929, while many of Europe\u2019s most respected banking\nhouses and currencies teetered on the brink of collapse. Although\nby the late 1930s, some semblance of recovery was achieved, it was\nneither complete nor sustained. If it had not been for the outbreak\nof the Second World War, it is very likely the world economy would\nhave entered a new \u2018Great Depression\u2019 after 1937.\n\nThe Great Depression had profound consequences for domestic\npolitics and international relations. When politicians from moderate,\ncentrist political parties (Liberals, Conservatives, reformist Socialists)\nfailed to implement policies to ease the crisis, they lost out to extremist\nparties to the Right and the Left of the political spectrum. European\ndiplomatic relations were also altered by the impact of the depression.\nThe severity of the crisis pushed countries to protect their national\ninterest above all else.

The world was now divided into competing monetary and\ntrading blocs, and this development, coupled with the new National\nSocialist government in Germany and Japan\u2019s descent into militarism,\nhad profound implications for international peace. For Germany and\nItaly, economic nationalism was the first step on the road to the\ncreation of empire. By 1935 it had become clear their nationalism\nwas not confined to economics as Mussolini and Hitler began to assert\nterritorial claims in the Mediterranean and Africa, although German\nambitions were soon to be directed at eastern Europe. It was also\nclear that the depression had undermined diplomatic cooperation\nand the ability of other countries to resist the aggressors\u2019 demands.\nIndeed, the atmosphere of intense economic competition soured\nrelations between countries who shared common diplomatic and\nstrategic interests, notably Britain, France and the United States.\n\nThis book offers a concise narrative and analytical account of this\nunprecedented \u2018Slump\u2019, the term Europeans used in the 1930s for\nwhat the Americans called the \u2018Great Depression\u2019 \u2014 a name usually\napplied to the period 1873-96 in Europe. The phrase \u2018Great\nDepression\u2019 has been adopted in the title of this book to underline\nthe commonality of the European and American experience in the\ndepression and to reflect the fact that the Great Depression was a\nglobal economic crisis. The book does not attempt to give a\ncomprehensive account of the economy of interwar Europe, but,\ninstead, to answer four central questions: what were the origins of\nthe depression? Why was it so severe? How was recovery effected and\nwas it sustainable? And what were the implications of that recovery\nfor political relations in, and between, nation-states?\n\nOne consequence of this focused and concise approach is that the\ndiscussion pays greater attention to the economic history of some\ncountries than others. This asymmetry reflects the nature of the\ninternational economy, where the actions of large nations can have a\nhuge impact on smaller ones. Countries with open and powerful\neconomies, like those of Britain, France, Germany and America,\ninevitably played a bigger role in the history of the depression than\nlesser economies, or those that were isolated from the international\neconomy, like that of Spain, by their choice of economic and/or\nforeign policy. None the less, the discussion does attempt to draw in\nall the regions, if not all the nations, of Europe. At the same time, it\npays attention to national case studies and events, like Britain\u2019s\n''"

The tables that accompany the text,\ntoo, are intended to be illustrative, not comprehensive.\n\nThe book is written explicitly with non-economists in mind. The\ntroubled economic history of Europe in the interwar period is an\nessential component in the political, social and cultural history of\nthe period. Yet thanks, in part, to the increasingly cultural bent of\npolitical history and the impact of econometrics on economic history,\nthe political and economic developments of the period are often\ntreated entirely separately. The purpose of this book is to introduce\nstudents of interwar Europe to recent research on the history of the\ndepression and help to reintegrate it into our understanding of the\npolitical, domestic and international history of the period. The\nexplanations of the few technical terms used are not confined to a\nglossary because it is easier to understand economic developments\nand policies in their historical context. The page references in\nparenthesis, which appear from Chapter | onwards, are intended as\na short cross-reference to the first time an important economic process\nis discussed.\n\nThe material in the book is organized around central themes\n(identified by chapter titles and subheadings), however the structure\nremains chronological. This is because chronology is important in\nunderstanding the origins of the Great Depression. In the 1920s it\nwas the perceived lessons of the history of the nineteenth century, as\nan era of unprecedented economic growth and European dominance\nin international trade, that shaped the policies adopted by statesmen\nand economic advisors when it came to the task of European\nreconstruction after 1918, sometimes with disastrous results. As\nChapters 1 and 2 demonstrate, the impact of the war and the postwar\ninflation that spiralled into hyperinflation in much of central and\neastern Europe played a crucial role in shaping the public\u2019s\nexpectations of government and economic policy after 1924.\nThereafter, currency stabilization became the dominant, sometimes\nthe sole, preoccupation of government policy, while the rules\ngoverning the behaviour of central banks were changed with\nimportant consequences for events in the Great Depression.

The strong\ndetermination to avoid inflation (currency chaos) remained, although\nthe fear made little sense in the current context.? Nor could\ngovernments shake the habit of interpreting almost all problems as\nfinancial ones.*\n\nInevitably, the need to organize the discussion under neat\nsubheadings also gives the misleading impression of order, when so\nmuch of the history of the Great Depression was about disorder. The\norigins of the Great Depression were political and social, as well as\neconomic, in origin. They traversed national and regional frontiers.\nNor did they respect the boundaries of \u2018time\u2019 delineated by historians.\nTo give one important example: while the Wall Street Crash of\nOctober 1929 continues to mark the onset of the economic collapse,\nhistorians have long agreed that, for central and eastern Europe, at\nleast, the Great Depression began in 1928 (some have even argued\nfor 1927). They also accede that it was not the Wall Street Crash, but\nthe policy response to it, which caused the depression to become\n\u2018Great\u2019. Even within Europe, countries entered the Great Depression\nat different times: Britain was one of the first nations affected, France\nwas one of the last.\n\nThe need for brevity has helped to shape this book\u2019s preoccupation\nwith the relationship between politics and economics. There is much\nmore that could have been said about the impact of the Great\nDepression on European society, although this remains a\ncomparatively under-researched topic when set against what we know\nabout the social history of the two world wars. The preoccupation\nwith financial policy also reflects the present state of scholarship on\nthe Great Depression. Some of the weaknesses which rendered the\nEuropean economy increasingly vulnerable to the economic and\nfinancial shocks experienced after 1929, were the \u2018natural\u2019\nconsequence of agricultural and industrial changes already under\nway in the nineteenth century. The process of \u2018Americanization\u2019 also\nplayed a role. But in the past ten years or so, a new scholarly consensus\nhas emerged regarding the causes of the Great Depression. The most\nimportant contribution has been a new appreciation of the role of\nthe international gold standard. The discussion here has moved on\nfrom technical explorations of how this fixed exchange mechanism\nfailed to operate as predicted, to examine the policy regime and\nassumptions underpinning the impact of the gold standard on distinct\nnational economies as well as the international economy as a whole.\u201d\n''"

The nature\nand extent of countries\u2019 commitment to the gold standard underlines\nthe importance of policy (not markets) to the history of the interwar\neconomy and to the power of domestic political priorities in shaping\neconomic policy. Research into what has become known as the\n\u2018historical political economy\u2019 has been especially fruitful, although\nmuch remains to be done. This explores the political behaviour of\ndifferent interest groups \u2014 landowners, tenant farmers, small\nbusinessmen, bankers, trade unions and so on \u2014 and their impact on\nthe evolution of economic policy. Their behaviour helps to explain\nwhy one policy is chosen over another. These studies also draw out\nhow the political, constitutional and social context of each country\nplayed a vital role in shaping each nation\u2019s distinct approach to the\ncrisis.\n\nIn the Great Depression, European countries faced very similar\nproblems and dilemmas, but opted to tackle them on their own. In\nthe 1930s there was much talk of the need for international\ncooperation \u2014 now believed to be the most effective step to curing\nthe depression \u2014 but very little action. The international system grew\nonly more fragmented as the decade went on. The book\u2019s original\ncontribution to current scholarship on the Great Depression is its\nattention to the international dimensions of the crisis. It explores\nwhat European countries understood by, and expected from,\ninternational economic cooperation. Here the discussion steps beyond\nthe boundaries of Europe to ask how far the absence of American\nleadership in the international economy can explain the failure of\ninternational cooperation. The book draws on archival materials to\nilluminate how measures adopted to fight the depression affected\ncountries\u2019 ability to prepare for the Second World War, as well as\ntheir impact on diplomacy more generally after 1931.\n\nFor much of the 1930s, the economic causes of war was a hot topic\nin intellectual circles.

Domestic political\nchange altered the context for, and expectations of, economic policy.\nSo, too, did territorial modifications, notably in central and eastern\nEurope, brought about by the postwar peace settlements. These political\ndevelopments, alongside bitter divisions over reparations and war debts,\nand the failure of the Paris Peace Conference to create an institutional\nframework to facilitate international economic cooperation, provided\nthe ideal climate for economic nationalism to flourish.\n\nThe Visible Costs of the War\n\nIn 1919, managing the peace was the most immediate problem that\nfaced the political leaders of a war-weary Europe. The situation was\ndifferent from that after the Second World War, for few plans for\npostwar Europe had been drafted by the Allies during the First World\nWar, yet the damage caused by the war to Europe\u2019s economy was\nsubstantial \u201cPhe loss of life and monies were amongst the most easily\nquantifiable of its costs. The number of deaths and casualties was\nunprecedented and at the time many believed this would be a serious\nimpediment to Europe\u2019s economic recovery, particularly as fighting\ncontinued in Russia, Poland, Hungary, the Balkans and Turkey long\nafter the armistice was signed on 11 November 1918. Estimates as to\nhow many men were killed or wounded in battle vary. Historians\ncalculate total losses of between 9.4 and 11 million people, a figure\nwhich amounted to over one per cent of Europe\u2019s population in 1913.\nExpressed nationally, Germany lost 2 037 000 men, Russia 1 811 000,\nFrance 1 398 000, Austria-Hungary 1 100 000 and Britain 723 000. Only\nAmerican casualties were substantially less, with 114000 killed in\naction.\u201d These military losses posed a greater challenge to the postwar\neconomic order when expressed in relation to the labour supplysFrance\nand Germany lost around 10 per cent of their male workforce; Austria-\nHungary and Italy over 6 per cent; and Britain around 5 per cent.\nCivilian deaths and injuries, the majority through malnourishment and\ndisease (particularly in the wake of the 1918 influenza epidemic which\nkilled more people than the war proper), were more severe and more\ndifficult to calculate, although all were agreed that the figures for the\ncasualties of war were much higher than ever before.\n''"

Its demographic costs were disproportionately high, as was\nthe damage to its infrastructure and industry. In all, some 15 000 km?\nof France were laid waste, and damage to French municipal, private\nand industrial buildings amounted to $17 000 million, the lion\u2019s share\nof a world loss of $29 960 million. Much of the remaining physical\ndamage wrought by the war was concentrated in western Russia, Poland\nand Belgium. In Belgium no aspect of life was untouched by war. Four\nyears of occupation and warfare on Belgian soil had brought industry\nto its knees. Here the Germans had gone as far as to partially dismantle\nBelgian factories and transfer their equipment to Germany.\n\nNone the less, Europe\u2019s population and infrastructure was to recover\ncomparatively quickly. In the west of Europe the population rose from\n170.2 million in 1920 to 189.9 million in 1940, although there was only\nslight growth in France and Austria, and a static population level in\nIreland. In the east and south the statistics were more impressive. In\neastern Europe the population rose from 84.4 million to 102.4 million\nbetween 1920 and 1940, and in the south it increased from 68.6 million\nto 84.9 million over the same period. The impetus for the rise came\nfrom the continued popularity of marriage at an early age and\nimprovements in health-care. Although it may seem heartless to say,\nthe slaughter of the trenches was not a serious impediment to Europe\u2019s\neconomic recovery, particularly as the character of European\npopulation migration had also begun to change. Scots, Germans and\nRussians, for instance, no longer migrated in large numbers to the\nUnited States as the open door of New York gradually edged shut. The\nend of large-scale emigration, however, had important implications\nfor structural adjustment in Europe since it was no longer possible to\nexport regional or national unemployment problems to the United\nStates and Australasia, for example, as it had been in the nineteenth\ncentury.\n\nIt proved easier for European governments to recover from the loss\nof life than the loss of important markets for trade, newly distorted\npatterns of industrial production and the financial costs of the war.\nThe disruption to established patterns of trade was the most damaging,\nfor it was hard to reverse the changes and poor trade performance\nmade it all the more difficult for Europe to recover the financial costs\nof the war. Most dramatic was the arrival of new competitors outside\nEurope, notably the United States and Japan. Both countries had\n''"

Both the newcomers experienced a trebling in their export\nlevels, although this was not sustained in the 1920s. More importantly,\nthe United States and Japan penetrated markets overseas previously\ndominated by Europe\u2019s leading powers. American exports to Latin\nAmerica rose by more than 75 per cent in 1916. In Asia, Japan built on\nits expertise in silk manufacture to considerably expand its textile\nexports to the United States and China and, for the first time, to export\ntextiles to Britain (this was particularly bad news for the textile\nmanufacturers of Lancashire). During and after the war, Japan also\nexpanded its capacity to produce its own iron and ships \u2014 developments\nwhich hit Britain in particular \u2014 chemicals and machinery.\n\nOn the whole, countries which had industrialized to some degree,\nincluding European neutrals like Denmark, were better placed to take\nadvantage of the temporary indisposition of the industrialized\nEuropean belligerents than the developing world: manufacturing\nproduction in Latin America and the British Empire, with a few\nexceptions, grew at modest levels throughout the war. But it was not\nall good news for Japanese and American manufacturers. The\nexpansion of their heavy industries only served to contribute to a global\nproblem which had already begun to plague Europe before the\noutbreak of war, and was exacerbated by its prosecution and the short-\nlived postwar boom of 1919-21: global overcapacity in the production\nof ships, iron and steel, and coal. The character of Europe\u2019s domination\nof the world economy in the nineteenth century contained within it\nthe seeds of problems which were to germinate in the 1920s with, for\nexample, the reliance on heavy industrial output. Many European\nplants became increasingly uncompetitive, notably in Italy where, from\nthe beginning, industrialization was tightly bound up with the state\u2019s\ndetermination to establish a heavy industrial base for strategic purposes.\n\nWriting in 1949, Arthur Lewis calculated the delay to Europe\u2019s long-\nterm expansion caused by the war by comparing the increase in output\nbetween 1913 and 1929 with what it would have been if pre-1913 trends\nhad continued without a break.

So, following this reasoning, one might argue that Europe\u2019s\nindustrial development was set back some eight years as a result of the\nwar. Of course, such an approach is a simplistic one as there is no\nplace in this model for variables, other than world war, which might\nhave accelerated or interrupted economic growth. One such variable\nwas the changing composition of trade. Even without the war, European\nmanufacturers would have faced the challenge of adapting production\nto supply the growing demand for consumer products which pointed\nthe way to future economic growth.\n\nThe arrival of American technology, products and methods of\nindustrial organization underlined the fact that the century of\nEuropean economic dominance had closed, to be succeeded by the\n\u2018American century\u2019 \u2014 a development which generated both attraction\nand resistance across the Atlantic. By the 1960s and 1970s, historians\nmade greater play in their accounts of the structural difficulties (the\ndecline of the so-called heavy industries) which plagued the European,\nand most notably, the British economy. In most of central and eastern\nEurope, moreover, there was a pronounced recession in consumer\ngoods for most of the 1920s \u2014 economists call it a transition crisis \u2014 as\ninvestment and demand remained concentrated on producer goods,\ndespite the fact that before 1914 factories making consumer goods\nenjoyed higher levels of investment and productivity than heavy\nindustries. But more recent research argues that changes in the\nstructure of the world economy were not especially rapid in this period,\nparticularly when compared to the rapid pace of economic change\nafter the Second World War, and that a considerable upturn in\nconsumer goods production would not necessarily have helped the\nEuropean economy. Rather, the western European and, especially,\nAmerican economies grew more vulnerable to depression because of\nthe direction rather than the pace of change. Consumer industries,\nlike the motor car, pointed the way to the future, but politicians and\neconomists had yet to learn that the consumer market is notoriously\nfickle. In times of economic uncertainty people were, and are, unlikely\nto spend. This was especially so in the interwar period when most\nconsumer goods were bought on hire purchase. So the new consumer\nindustries (sometimes called \u2018sunrise\u2019 industries to contrast with the\n\u2018sunset\u2019 industries like shipbuilding) made western Europe and the\nUnited States more, not less, vulnerable to depression.\n\nThere was also the interdependence of the European economy, which\n''"

Germany was\nBritain\u2019s main industrial rival inside Europe, surpassing its production\nof coal, pig iron and steel, but Britain was also Germany\u2019s best customer,\nand Germany came second only to India as a customer for British goods.\nBritish coal was being burnt in Berlin when war broke out, at the same\ntime as blast furnaces were being built in France with the help of\nGerman capital and the Germans were making chemicals in Russia.\nJust as this interdependence was an important element in securing\nunprecedented rates of economic growth in Europe before the First\nWorld War (and after the Second World War), it also meant that each\ncountry\u2019s economic and financial vulnerabilities were burdens shared\nby all European powers.\n\nFor many in Europe, notably in central, southern and eastern Europe,\nwartime changes in primary production were more important than\nthe challenges faced by industry. Again, some of these changes were\nunder way before war broke out. The introduction of refrigerated ships\nmeant that cheap meat, from Argentina for example, could now be\nexported to European dinner tables. Primary producers in India and\nLatin America all saw the levels of their primary exports rise. To the\nnorth, the opening up of vast acreage in Canada, the United States\nand Russia to wheat production, ever more sophisticated methods of\nintensive farming, and a decline in the demand for cereal products in\npreference to dairy ones, all meant that European farmers, many if\nnot most of whom were smallholders, became increasingly un-\ncompetitive. Indeed, the disruption to Russian and eastern European\ncereal production during the mobile war on the Eastern Front\nprompted producers elsewhere to increase production: Canadian\nacreage was increased 80 per cent during the war, Argentine meat\nexports grew by 75 per cent, while, most spectacularly, the value of\nAmerican exports of wheat and flour more than tripled and meat\nexports rose tenfold between 1913 and 1918.\n\nThe new pattern of industrial and agricultural trade was not an\ninsuperable problem to western European governments after 1918\nprovided they could export enough manufactures to pay for the higher\nlevel of agricultural imports and provided they could appease their\nown agricultural communities.

In eastern and southern Europe the problem was even\nmore acute with over 70 per cent of the population earning a living\nfrom farming. At the time, many argued that these changes in world\nagriculture production were temporary. Diagnosing the problem is at\nleast half the battle in formulating effective economic and monetary\npolicy. Only as time wore on did it become clear that the war had helped\nto shunt industry and agriculture onto a new track.\n\nMany of the war-induced, or exacerbated, changes to the European\neconomy were obscured by the short-lived postwar boom between 1919\nand 1921 which sent out misleading signals to policy-makers. The boom\ndepended both on pent-up consumer demand \u2014 products which had\nbeen unavailable during the course of the war could once again be\nbought now that rationing was removed and production resumed \u2014\nand spending on government orders to replace war-damaged goods\nlike ships and railways. Smaller firms, less well placed to maintain their\nstocks than their larger rivals during wartime, also took the opportunity\nto restock their inventories. The speed and vigour of the postwar boom\ntook many commentators by surprise as they had anticipated a serious\nrecession after the war when military expenditure was curtailed and\nservicemen demobilized. European policy-makers were temporarily\nblinded to many of the difficulties confronting them by the spending\nboom, but most were troubled profoundly when, in the summer of\n1919, inflation in all European countries began to rise steadily.\n\nThe \u2018Invisible Price\u2019: The Financial Costs of the War\n\nFrom war\u2019s end to the beginning of 1921, Europe experienced the\nhelter-skelter of deflation and stagnation, followed by inflation and\nboom, before the collapse of prices and production. Between 1871\nand 1900 many of the world\u2019s leading powers joined the gold standard.\nIt was a fixed exchange mechanism (currencies were convertible into\ngold at a fixed rate) that helped to regulate currency movements and\nto facilitate the exchange of currency and goods between countries\n(p. 41). However, at the outbreak of war, European powers (and later\nthe United States) had acted to constrain the effects of gold\nconvertibility on their national currencies. In other words, although\ncountries like Britain and France theoretically remained on the gold\nstandard to control inflation and to maintain confidence in the currency,\nlimits were placed on the export of gold and extensive controls\n''"

The growth of inflation\nwas inevitable without constraints to control it in the climate of want\nand dislocation which accompanied war\u2019s end across Europe. The fact\nthat many goods were in short supply also encouraged prices to go up.\nFrom the spring of 1919 until the spring of 1922 prices rose by 50 per\ncent before falling again. Some historians see the increase in inflation\nas a major contributing element in the postwar boom and bust, while\nothers regard the upsurge in inflation as purely incidental. More \u2014\nimportant than determining the contribution of the monetary\nexpansion in 1919-20 to the postwar boom, however, was the revelation\nto working- and middle-class men and women across Europe that their\ngovernments faced profound problems managing their national\ncurrency, regardless of whether it was the world-renowned pound\nsterling or the newly established Yugoslavian dinar.\n\nThe impact of the postwar inflation \u2014 its origins, its myriad impact\non different European societies, particularly those of continental\nEurope, and lessons drawn by leading politicians, economists and the\nelectorate \u2014 was very important in helping to shape economic and\nmonetary policies during the subsequent decade. Eichengreen, the\nleading economic historian of the depression, has placed monetary\nelements at the centre of his account of the Great Depression. These\nfactors are complex, and sometimes unnecessarily forbidding to the\nnon-economist.

Therefore, throughout 1914-15, as\nboth the Entente and Central powers competed for the sympathy of\nthe American public and the support of the United States government,\nthe exchange rate of the US dollar took a battering as European\ngovernments and investors sold their US assets in exchange for gold.\nSo much for economists\u2019 claims for the \u2018efficiency of markets\u2019, the\nspectre of war in Europe had caused the value of the US dollar to fall!\nThis did not endear Europe to the United States, although the situation\nsoon changed dramatically as the prerogatives of the war economy\ndetermined that Europe\u2019s creditor nations sacrifice assets to win the\nwar, and the United States became the world\u2019s leading creditor.

In August 1915, in words which were later\nto haunt him, the German Finance Minister, Karl Helfferich, claimed,\n\u2018the instigators of this war have earned this dead weight of billions\u2019.\u2019\nThe issue of taxation was also problematic because the two-tier structure\nof Reich government prevented the Kaiser\u2019s war cabinet from levying\ndirect taxes. The Ldnder (states) did increase rates of direct taxation \u2014\nthey doubled during the war \u2014 but their contribution to the overall\nfinance of the war remained small. Instead, the state had to rely heavily\non indirect taxation. In 1915 Helfferich agreed to levy taxes on tobacco,\nbeers and spirits, rail fares and postage, but strongly resisted Socialist\ndemands for taxation to be extended to more lucrative areas like war\nprofits or mortgages. By 1917, however, German profit tax was fixed at\n60 per cent.\n\nBritain seemed better placed than the remainder of Europe to pay\nfor the war. The principle and practice of levying income and direct\ntaxation was well established, and in November 1914 Chancellor of\nthe Exchequer David Lloyd George doubled income tax and supertax\nrates (by 1918/19 British income tax was fourfold its 1913/14 rate).\nThere were also considerable hikes in indirect taxation, too, with duties\nup on beer and tea, and, ina historic departure from Britain\u2019s cherished\nfree trade, custom duties were extended to most imports except\ndesperately needed supplies of food.\n\nIn many instances, however, government preferred to shy away from\nthe practical and political problems of taxation by raising loans at home\nand abroad. Britain and, later, the United States were able to finance\ntheir wartime budget deficits with long-term loans. They, like all the\nbelligerents, also issued government bonds \u2014 war bonds (in Britain)\nand Liberty Loans (in the USA) to the public. France, too, slid into\nfurther debt at home and overseas. The volume of French national\ndebt appeared to grow more slowly than that of Britain and Germany,\nbut this was only because the French state, like its Russian ally, was\nheavily in debt before the war broke out. (The overall level of French\nnational debt was high because of the reparations imposed by Germany\nas a consequence of the Franco-Prussian war.)\n\nIn Europe the growth of the German domestic public debt surpassed\nall others. By 1918 it had grown tenfold from its 1914 figure. The\ngovernment's inability to raise sufficient capital from taxation and its\n''"

By 1918 the German imperial debt was 156.1\nbillion marks; it had been 5.4 billion in 1914. Moreover, the German\ngovernment was not the only one in search of credit: German\nmerchants, industrialists and small businessmen needed it too. As a\nconsequence the Reichsbank discounted a growing quantity of Treasury\nbills, and the volume of currency in circulation grew at an alarming\npace. All European belligerents printed money with insufficient reserves\nin order to pay for the war effort, although most deployed controls,\nlike the rent and debt moratorium introduced in France in August\n1914, to prevent price rises. Even so, during the war countries\nexperienced considerable inflation \u2014 in France the wholesale price\nindex rose from 100 in 1913 to 340 in 1918 (over the same period the\nBritish price index rose to 227, Italy\u2019s to 409, Germany\u2019s to 415 and\nHungary\u2019s to the spectacular figure of 2287); in Russia (between 1914\nand 1918) wages only doubled, while prices rose by around 500 per\ncent, causing serious hardship.\n\nIn 1918, despite these indicators, most politicians and financiers in\nEurope (aside from those in civil war wrecked Russia) believed that the\ntide of inflation and exchange rate depreciation could and would be\nreversed at war\u2019s end. So long as the political climate fostered this\noptimistic view, bond holders across Europe, whether citizens or subjects,\nwere prepared to hold onto their government bonds and roll over the\nstate debt (buy new bonds) when their existing bonds matured. However,\nif and when confidence was disturbed, the consequences were dramatic:\nmembers of the public acted quickly to sell their bonds, forcing the\nstate to transfer some its scant cash reserves to the Treasury from the\ncentral bank, thereby boosting inflation, and, at the same time, limiting\nthe power of the government and central bank to control it.\n\nEven more important to the transformation of postwar financial\nrelations than the growth of taxes and monies loaned by citizens and\nsubjects to their governments was the wholesale liquidation of foreign\nassets and the accumulation of foreign liabilities.(All the European\nbelligerents had lost loans and bonds invested overseas when war broke\nout, and the Entente powers accumulated large debts to the United\nStates during the course of the war.

In much the same way that imperial rivalries had paved\nthe road to war, imperial alliances helped to extend the financial\nconsequences of the war around the globe. Although some recent\naccounts argue that the levels of European indebtedness triggered by\nthe war have been overestimated, the levels remain considerable. France\nborrowed heavily from Britain (around $3 billion dollars) and the\nUnited States ($2.9 billion dollars), and Britain borrowed from the\nUnited States ($4.3 billion dollars), while imperial allies, as well as\nEuropean ones like Russia, Italy, Belgium and Serbia, borrowed from\nBritain and France. Bereft of empire and without powerful and wealthy\n\u2018friends\u2019 overseas, Germany and Austria-Hungary relied less on\ninternational credit and, as we have seen, had little choice but to extend\nthe tax burden, particularly to war profits.\n\nWho Will Be the World\u2019s Banker?\n\nBy 1919 it was clear that the emergent manufacturing strength of the\nUnited States was dwarfed by its new found financial supremacy. Before\nthe First World War, Britain had been the world\u2019s banker \u2014 it was the\nprimary source of overseas investment capital. In the second half of\nthe nineteenth century, sterling\u2019s pre-eminence as a trading and reserve\ncurrency, alongside Britain\u2019s promotion of free trade, had helped to\nfoster stability and growth in the international economy. In 1914,\nregardless of new rivals on the international stage, Britain was the only\nEuropean country that was selling more outside Europe than inside it.\nBritish purchases of European manufactures and other products were\npaid for in cash, and with overseas produce. Britain exported capital\nto the rest of the world as well as manufactures. In 1914, 43 per cent of\nthe world\u2019s foreign investment in 1914 was British, with Germany\nproviding 13 per cent and the United States only 8 per cent.

The need to finance\nthe payment and transportation of imports from the United States to\nEurope increased the amount Europe owed to the United States and\nmade global capital movements, and therefore the economy as a whole,\nmore vulnerable to any monetary and economic shocks.\n\nIn the scramble to secure resources to pay for essential war and\npostwar imports, governments were also forced, albeit reluctantly, to\npart with some of the gold reserves kept in their central banks for the\npeacetime management of currency; much of the gold found its way\nacross the Atlantic. Here Britain was a notable exception. The Bank of\nEngland\u2019s gold reserves actually went up during the war, boosted by\nthe patriotic donations of gold from its citizens and newly mined gold\nfrom the Empire. Of the main European belligerents, France, Belgium,\nGermany and Italy lost gold during the war, a trend partly offset by the\naccumulation of foreign reserves in place of gold, to finance trade.\nThe \u2018invisible\u2019 costs of the war \u2014 indebtedness and the changing balance\nof monetary power \u2014 were to be exaggerated by further intra-European\nindebtedness generated by the peace treaties signed at the Paris Peace\nConference. Both wartime and peacetime debts were to have important\nconsequences for international monetary stability and diplomatic\nrelations between the world\u2019s leading economic actors in the interwar\nperiod.\n\nThe Peace Settlements\n\nThe peace treaties, negotiated for the most part at the Paris Peace\nConference in 1919, had a number of important consequences on an\ninternational and national level for the future health and stability of\nthe European economy. The first blow to the prospects of international\ncooperation on every level, including economic, came with the\nAmerican Senate\u2019s failure to ratify the Covenant of the League of\nNations and the Treaty of Versailles. As is well known, the American\nPresident, Woodrow Wilson, worked hard to foster European support\nfor his, at first vague, plan for an organization which would safeguard\ninternational peace and serve as a forum for a more orderly\nmanagement of the world\u2019s political, economic, financial and cultural\naffairs.

Thereafter, regardless of whether\neconomic or diplomatic issues were under discussion, the European\npowers claimed that American \u2018irresponsibility\u2019 in November 1919 gave\nthem ample reason to distrust the United States. The League now fell\nunder Anglo-French domination and the failure of collective security\nprompted a knee-jerk reaction from France, who, throughout the 1920s,\nresolutely maintained that the Paris treaties could not be revised.

Today\u2019s political scientists offer\nconflicting interpretations of the impact of proportional representation\nfor economic policy: its supporters argue that proportional represent-\nation enhances political stability by encouraging compromise by parties\nwho wish to avoid toppling the government; its critics argue that\nproportional representation increases the likelihood of political\ninstability and policy deadlock by investing a large number of interest\ngroups with the power to bring down a coalition or minority government\nif it attempts to pursue a policy inconsistent with the group\u2019s interests.\nThe history of interwar Europe demonstrates that there is an element of\ntruth to both claims. Put simply, the most important factor in determining\nwhether a coalition or minority government survived was the importance\nof the topic under dispute. If trouble blew up over a minor issue, it was\nin the interests of the coalition partners to cooperate, for the costs of\nbringing down the government and the subsequent political instability\nwere likely to be much higher than any political gain. But for most of\nthe 1920s, many European governments were in dispute over\nfundamental questions like the level and distribution of taxes, and the\nextent and character of government welfare provision (particularly when\ngovernments were preparing for a return to the gold standard). Germany,\nBelgium, Italy, France, Poland and Hungary all struggled to form stable\ngovernments in the face of disputes over who should pay for, or benefit\nfrom, government spending.\n\nIn 1922 Italian democracy\u2019s failure to survive distributional conflict\nresulted in a fascist government led by Benito Mussolini, who claimed\nthat such distributional friction was damaging to \u2018national vitality\u2019 and\n''"

For\nmost of the 1920s, the political systems of Germany, Belgium and France\nsurvived because the postwar inflationary crisis (coupled with\nexaggerated fears of a communist coup), both compelled and facilitated\npolitical cooperation amongst leading coalition members. This was to\nchange after 1929. Moreover, conflict over economic policy was\nheightened in Germany and France, in comparison to countries like\nCzechoslovakia and the Netherlands, because of the magnitude of the\ntask of reconstruction and because social groups were defined\npredominantly on economic lines (particularly given the contribution\nof economic success to the legitimization of the nation-state forged by\nBismarck). In Dutch and Czechoslovak politics, by contrast, religious\nand ethnic questions were every bit as pressing as economic ones, which\nmeant that in times of crisis, economic issues could be traded against\nreligious or ethnic issues to preserve the power of the governing\ncoalition.\n\nIn 1919 it was not just the structure of the many European political\nsystems that had changed, the extension of the franchise was equally\nimportant.

This sum, in\nturn, was divided into segments and the London Schedule, as the 1921\ncommission\u2019s report became known, provided for two bond series\ntotalling only 50 milliard gold marks, on which the German government\nwould have to pay interest and amortization (the redemption yield on\nthe bonds). The Reich remained legally responsible for an additional\n82 milliards of bonds (known as C-bonds), but this \u2018funny money\u2019 had\nmore of a political than economic significance. The Reparation\nCommission intended to sell these bonds on the open market only if\nand when Germany was prosperous enough to service them. In the\nmeantime, the European allies hoped to use them as \u2018bargaining chips\u2019\nto persuade the Americans to reduce, and ultimately abolish, war debts.\nAccording to Schuker\u2019s calculations, under the London Schedule\nGermany would have had to pay reparations amounting to 5.37 per\ncent of 1921 national income. Therefore, it was not the volume of\nGerman reparation payments, but their interaction with the already\ncomplex, sometimes confusing, and certainly damaging network of debt\ncreated by the war that marks the first contribution of reparations to\nthe origins of the depression.\n\nThe second damaging consequence of reparations and war debts\nwas their impact on European-American relations. In his appreciation\nof French policy, Trachtenberg demonstrates the essential link between\nFrench reparation demands and the American commitment, orrather\nlack of it, to French economic reconstruction and security. In private,\nthe French government expressed its willingness to reduce its\n''"

It is an interpretation that deflects criticism of French policy\nback onto President Wilson\u2019s unwillingness to make concessions to\nCongress over the Covenant and the latter\u2019s subsequent rejection of\nthe Treaty of Versailles. Even more important to the origins of the\ndepression, although also contingent on American policy, was the vexed\nquestion of inter-allied debts.\n\nAlmost from the outset it was clear that the European Allies hoped\nto trade any reduction in the volume of German reparations for a\nreduction in their debts to the United States. In the years that followed,\nthe United States\u2019 \u2018moral\u2019 stance of refusing to demand reparations,\nyet insisting on the collection of, in President Calvin Coolidge\u2019s words,\nthe \u2018hired money\u2019 loaned to Europe rang increasingly hollow. The\nAmerican refusal to recognize any link between Germany\u2019s ability to\npay reparations and the capacity of Britain, France, Italy and others to\nmake their war debt payments bedevilled European-American\ndiplomatic and economic relations. The burgeoning postwar debt\nnexus, compounded by the Dawes Plan after 1924 in which almost\neveryone owed something to someone, undermined efforts to achieve\nEuropean currency stability. It also meant it was essential that European\ntrade recovered so that debtors could earn sufficient foreign currency\nand gold to repay their debts. But levels of international trade were\nslow to revive after the war and, to their chagrin, European governments\nfound the United States more interested in exporting to, than\nimporting from, Europe. Throughout the 1920s, the United States\nmaintained a protectionist wall of 33 per cent (average tariff rate)\naround its domestic market to politically appease powerful farmers\nand industrialists. In short, the Americans prevented the Europeans\nfrom selling enough to pay back their debts. The interaction between\ninternational indebtedness and protectionism was the third means by\nwhich reparations and war debts undermined the stability of the world\neconomy.\n\nThe final, and arguably most important, contribution of reparations\nand war debts to the fragility of the interwar economy is the complex\nstory of its relationship \u2018to the stability of the international capital\nmarket and the the impact of foreign Toans | to Germany in the wake of the\n1924 Dawes Plan (p. 37).

Germany\u2019s main excuse was a good\none: the inflationary spiral and the accompanying budget deficit which\nemerged during the war, was now growing beyond the government\u2019s\ncapacity to control it. But the German government's assertions that\nreparations caused the German descent into hyperinflation were\nmisleading.\n\nInflation and Hyperinflation\n\nThe history of the Weimar Republic\u2019s 1922-23 inflationary crisis is the\nbest documented of the waves of inflation that engulfed much of Europe\nfrom 1919 until 1924. However, France, Italy, Belgium, Czechoslovakia,\nHungary, Austria, Poland, Germany and the USSR all experienced\nserious inflation. In Britain the 1919 inflation rate of 50 per cent was\nactually one of the lowest in Europe. In central and eastern Europe\nthere were giddy hyperinflationary rates of over 2000 per cent per\nannum. The consequences of the inflation were more important than\nits causes to the origins of the Great Depression. In most of these\ncountries the source of the inflation lay in the war-induced expenditure\nbegun in 1914, and which, through civil war, did not end until 1922 in\nPoland and the new USSR.\n\nIn the immediate postwar period, the task of reconstruction and, in\naddition, serious conflicts over which interest groups should benefit\nfrom government spending rocked European society. These political\ndisputes generated a political tolerance to the burgeoning levels of\ninflation.| In November 1919 there was a German \u2018revolution\u2019 and\ncoincident left-wing revolutions in Hungary and Austria. \\Politicians\nacross the political spectrum feared triggering further social unrest\nthrough tax hikes, their anxieties compounded by the desperate need\nfor resources to pay for veterans\u2019 pensions, health-care schemes and\npostwar reconstruction. Governments did not just \u2018lavish\u2019 money on\nthe working classes to cool their revolutionary aspirations. The Weimar\nRepublic, for instance, also gave generous compensation payments to\nfirms that lost assets as a consequences of the territorial changes\nimposed by the Treaty of Versailles.

The bank was not only the chief source of credit to cover the\ngovernment\u2019s growing budget deficit, it also became the leading\ncreditor to the private sector: in December 1923 of the 931 000 million\ncrowns worth of notes in circulation (an increase of over 200 000 per\ncent on the 1913 level), over 60 per cent of these were commercial\nbills discounted by the bank. In Germany, too, the Reichsbank played\na vital role in discounting the state\u2019s floating debt to finance the\nrepublic\u2019s growing budget deficit. In some instances rivalries between\nfinancial institutions also fed the inflationary spiral. During the collapse\nof \u2018Liberal Italy\u2019, the harsh economic and financial environment of\nthe postwar era exacerbated the long-standing conflict between officials\nof the Treasury, the Bank of Italy in Rome and financiers of the largest\ncommercial banks in Milan. The bitter arguments between these\nfinanciers were dubbed the \u2018war between the banks\u2019 and soured\ncooperative efforts to control the monetary crisis. The role of banks in\nthe inflation also had long-term implications. The involvement of\ncentral banks, notably the Reichsbank, severely damaged their\nreputations as the guardians of sound currency and led to the\nimposition of tough restrictions on their ability to discount bills. In\nGermany this was to have important consequences for the Weimar\nRepublic\u2019s ability to fight economic recession in 1928 and world\ndepression after 1929 (p. 125).\n\nAs inflation swept Europe, the link between budget deficits and\nmonetary chaos was obvious and it became the single most important\nlesson drawn by politicians for their economic policy. In particular, it\nwas the famed German hyperinflation which began in the summer of\n1922 and culminated in the autumn of 1923 that lingered in the minds\nof politicians and electorates across Europe. But, in reality, the\ninflationary episode was a complex and varied ten-year-long affair\nwhich, until the collapse into hyperinflation, brought benefits as well\nas costs to many countries. On a political level, allowing inflation to\nrise appeared to be the \u2018least worst\u2019 solution to the challenge of\nmaintaining social peace when governments in central and eastern\nEurope were threatened by revolution. On an economic level, there\nwere also benefits. In Hungary 600 new enterprises were launched\nbetween 1921 and 1923.

Historians of Weimar\u2019s foreign and economic policy contend\nthat Chancellors Wirth (1921-22) and Cuno (1922-23) deliberately\npostponed balancing the budget and allowed the Weimar economy to\nsuccumb to hyperinflation in the hope that the chaos would, in Cuno\u2019s\nwords, \u2018deal with\u2019 (read abolish) \u2018reparations first and clean up the\ntax problem afterward\u2019.'*? International tension grew as the German\nForeign Office misleadingly claimed that it was reparation payments\nthat were generating the inflation. The French took the opposite\nperspective. Prime Minister Raymond Poincar\u00e9\u2019s decision to invade\nthe Ruhr in January 1923 sprang, in part, from the French conviction\nthat the Weimar Republic was using the inflationary chaos to undermine\nthe reparations settlement, or as the Germans put it, to put reparations\n\u2018on a businesslike\u2019 basis. Power politics also came into it. The invasion\nstemmed from Poincar\u00e9\u2019s determination to exploit the reparations issue\nto build on the political and military predominance France had secured\nafter the war to alter permanently European power relationships to\nfavour French, not German or Anglo-Saxon, interests.\n\nThe French and Belgian invasion of the Ruhr in January 1923, and\nCuno\u2019s policy of \u2018passive resistance\u2019, quickened the pace of the now\nhyperinflationary crisis until the mark collapsed (in January of that\nyear one US dollar bought 7260 marks, by December it bought over\n4210 billion marks). The occupation came to an end in September\n1923 when Chancellor Gustav Stresemann called a halt to German\npassive resistance and acted quickly to terminate the inflation. But\nFrance suffered too. Poincar\u00e9\u2019s piecemeal invasion of the Ruhr\ntriggered fierce new inflationary pressures on the French franc. The\ncrisis was only brought to a timely halt by Anglo-American intervention\nwith the Dawes Plan and new proposals to establish financial stability\nin Europe. The French move into financial crisis was intimately linked\nwith the fate of Germany.

Between 1920\nand 1925, levels of indirect taxation had doubled and direct taxation\nhad tripled in France. By 1927 the French government had spent twice\nas much on national reconstruction as it had received in reparation\npayments from Germany.\n\nAlthough it took another two years for France to secure a de facto\nstabilization of the franc, politicians drew some important lessons for\nfuture economic policy from the Europe-wide inflationary crisis of\n1922-23. Before 1923 the French public, most notably the central bank,\nthe educated public, the press and the overwhelming majority of the\nparliament, were already hostile to inflation with a zeal approaching\n\u2018religious fervour\u2019. After 1923 hostility towards inflation became the\nleitmotif of economic policy across all of Europe. As Feldman makes\nclear in his richly detailed study of the political, psychological and\nsociological impact of the German inflation, the political consequences\nof the inflation profoundly undermined support for the republic,\nparticularly among white-collar workers and Kleinrentier who saw their\npensions, savings and wages rendered worthless. In France, as in\nGermany, army officers, magistrates and senior civil servants\ntraditionally lived from their private sources of income and did not\nrely on their wages. The scale of the postwar inflation changed all this\nand one consequence was that during the 1920s the question of what\n\"we now Call \u2018public sector pay\u2019 became a subject of vociferous public\ndebate. The size of the tragedy is best revealed at the level of the\nindividual. In 1923, one sixty-year-old German man who had lived very\ncomfortably before the war on the interest from assets of 60 000 marks,\nwas working for 15 gold pfennigs an hour to try to support his three\nchildren: inflation had wiped out his assets. In the same year, the\npermanently disabled and orphaned daughter of a civil servant watched\nher 112 000 mark inheritance turn to worthless paper. In despair, she\ntwice attempted suicide (p. 58).\n\nRegardless of some of the economic benefits generated by the\ninflation, politicians and their constituents across Europe, whether to\nthe left or right of the political spectrum, came to regard the impact\nof inflation as little short of calamitous. The collective memory of the\nGerman people conflated the experience of the inflation with that of\nthe hyperinflation. This produced what Holtfrerich has called \u2018Inflation\n''"

Yet\nto historians like Boross and Holtfrerich, the postwar inflation granted\nan important boost to efforts at reconstruction and, in the case of\nGermany, provided an opportunity to roll back the gains made by labour\nduring 1918-19 that the Republic\u2019s political economy could not sustain.\nOnce currency stabilization was under way, big business secured a\nrealignment of the German state to favour industry rather than workers:\nworking hours were increased, the high level of real wages fell and the\ndistribution of taxation now favoured the interests of industry over the\nworking class. As Walter Rathenau, a leading industrialist and former\nEconomics Minister, put it in 1919, a longer working day \u2018gave exactly\nthe number of hours needed to pay reparations\u2019.'*\n\nHowever, in the longer term the hyperinflation had very damaging\npolitical and economic consequences.

As will be shown in Chapters 2 and 3, it also did serious\ndamage to the prospects of European economic and financial recovery.\nNot only did rampant inflation destroy governments which were unable\nto manage the political and social conflict generated by the crisis, like\nthat of Italy in 1922, the inflation undermined the sovereignty of\nEuropean governments on a symbolic level too. The emblems of the\nnation decorated and distinguished each national currency, and just\nas the value of every note declined with inflation, so, too, the sovereignty\nof the state was visibly devalued and eroded. {During Weimar\u2019s\nhyperinflation, local government authorities and industrialists printed\nover 2000 different \u2018currencies\u2019 to pay their workforce.\n\nIn the short term, the destruction of the mark also created new\ndifficulties for Germany and the European economy as a whole: in\nWeimar there was an acute shortage of capital in the factory and in the\nhome; the French franc became increasingly unstable and investment\nwas also in short supply; the vulnerable eastern Europe economy,\n''"

The European economy urgently needed\nan injection of capital and a successful initiative to stabilize its\ncurrencies, and the Americans held the key to both.\n\nThe Dawes Plan, 1924\n\n|The Dawes plan marked the re-entry of the United States into European\n\naffairs. Unlike 1917, this time American intervention was much more\nin keeping with the traditional economic focus of US foreign policy.|\nBefore and during the Ruhr crisis American bankers had been\nsympathetic to calls for American investment in Europe, and\nparticularly in Germany. Given that there were no international\norganizations from which to borrow money, and that traditional lenders\nin countries like Britain, France and the Netherlands tried to husband\ntheir financial resources for their own national and imperial needs,\nAmerican money was central to the stabilization of postwar Europe.\nThis did not mean that British bankers, the dynamic and dominant\nforce in international financial affairs in the nineteenth century, were\nunimportant. In 1923 and 1924 Montagu Norman, governor of the\nBank of England, took a prominent role in encouraging American\ninvolvement and defining the parameters of the proposed loan to\nGermany, although his plan to have the new German currency linked\nto the pound rather than the dollar (via gold), thereby putting sterling\nrather than the gold-linked dollar at the heart of the European\neconomy, came to nothing.\n\nThe machinery of international economic cooperation in the 1920s\nwas much like that of the nineteenth century. It was dominated more\nby bankers and businessmen and less by treasury or finance ministry\nrepresentatives. \u2018This was especially true of the United States, where\nprivate bankers assumed a powerful role in the creation of the Federal\nReserve System, the American \u2018central bank\u2019 in 1913, and the\nformulation and implementation of American foreign policy after 1919.\nThe national and international power of private businessmen and\nfinanciers, like Thomas Lamont, a Director of J. P. Morgan\u2019s bank,\nreflected the spirit of the \u2018roaring twenties\u2019 and the desire of the\nAmerican business_community to secure the European market for\nAmerican exports./The spirit of competition as much as cooperation\nmotivated American policy in Europe.

At the time, however, the\n\u2018informality\u2019 of the new American commitment to European stability\nsuited successive Republican administrations and American public\nopinion, all of which were wary of political entanglements in Europe.\n\nIn 1924 American financiers were adamant that Germany would not\nbe able to secure international loans unless the burden of reparations\non its economy was reduced and European diplomatic relations, notably\nbetween Germany and France, were put on a more stable footing. These\nconsiderations had an important impact on a conference convened in\nLondon that year to resolve the reparations crisis. To put the minds of\nthe bankers at rest, the London conference revised the volume and\nmanner of collection of Germany\u2019s reparation payments and, as Schuker\nhas demonstrated, markedly weakened France\u2019s ability to enforce the\ncollection of reparations in future. It also redistributed the European\nbalance of power favouring Germany over France, and, once the loan\nwas in place, determined that the Allies would service Germany\u2019s loans\neven if it defaulted on reparations.\n\nThe Dawes Plan did not address the issue of Germany\u2019s overall\nliability. Instead, in the words of the committee of experts who reported\nto the Reparation Committee, the plan offered a schedule of annual\npayments to restore confidence and thereby facilitate a final settlement.\nConditions imposed within the plan demanded that Germany balance\nits budget, and that the Reichsbank be reformed to act as a bank of\nissue of notes on a stable basis in relation to gold. In short, the Dawes\nPlan meant that Germany now had to commit itself to the gold standard.\nThe plan also included a foreign loan of 800 million marks (\u00a340\nmillion) paid directly to the German government. The loan was\nregarded as essential to the plan\u2019s success: partly as foreign currency\nreserve for the Reichsbank, partly to finance deliveries in kind during\nthe initial period of German recovery, and in general to create an\natmosphere of confidence, a necessity if the Dawes Plan was to succeed.\n\nAt first the majority of American bankers were pessimistic about the\nplan\u2019s chances of success, although they had secured much of what\nthey had wanted at the London conference to give Germany \u2018a sporting\n''"

Lamont wondered whether Dawes had done enough to give\n\u2018the investor in German bonds to suppose that he will have a fair run\nfor his money\u2019.'\u00b0 But the sceptics were soon proved wrong. Under the\nskilful stewardship of Stresemann and the currency commissioner of\nthe Reichsbank who was to become its most controversial director, Dr\nHjalmar Schacht, the stabilization of the Reichsmark was highly\nsuccessful. Both thereby secured their reputations as the men who had\nbrought stability to Germany and Schacht\u2019s considerable ego was\nundoubtedly massaged by such popular tributes as: \u2018Wer hat die\nRentenmark erdacht? Der Demokrat, der Doktor Schacht? [\u2018Who invented\nthe Rentenmark? The Democrat, Dr Schacht\u2019].'!\u00b0 The stable currency\nand favourable interest rates, prompted foreign investors to purchase\nhuge volumes of German bonds \u2014 worth around $2.6 billion \u2014 over 60\nper cent of which were purchased by Americans, while British and\nDutch investors each took around 12 per cent of the German bonds.\nThanks to this deluge of foreign credit under the Dawes Plan, Germany\nwas able to meet its reparation obligations in full, although each year\nthere was always a slight default as a \u2018point of honour\u2019. By 1930 the\nGerman economy was hostage to a debt of some 26 billion RM\n(independent of its reparation liabilities), which accounted for one-\nthird of total investment in the German economy (its national income\nwas around 75 billion a year). At the same time, German loans became\nan important part of the American economy, as 20 per cent of the\nAmerican capital market comprised foreign bonds sold in the United\nStates. As we shall see, the pattern of hyperinflation followed by an\nunhealthy dependence on foreign capital was repeated elsewhere in\ncentral and eastern Europe.\n\nAmerican investors were attracted to the high rates of interest and\nthe apparent security of the investment opportunities. Germany\u2019s iron\nand steel industry, the mostly stagnant textile industry, agriculture and\nmunicipalities like the City of Cologne, all used their past reputations\n(rather than their current profit records) and their political muscle to\nsecure a disproportionate share of US dollars; the municipalities alone\nsecured around 12 per cent of all long-term loans issued by the United\nStates. Therefore, despite the flood of Dawes Plan capital, a large\nproportion of the investment was not productive. The American\nadministration was not ignorant of the dangers of the situation. It issued\nstern warnings to American investors that their German bonds\nremained subject to \u2018the political risks of Europe\u2019 and that they would\nbe better off putting their money into \u2018good safe American securities\n''"

European Union plans\nfor monetary union have also helped to revive interest in this system of\nfixed exchange rates. Most economic historians now agree that the\ncharacter and operation of the interwar gold standard, more than any\nother single contributory element, exacerbated many of the problems\nof the European economy in the 1920s, turned the 1928/29 recession\ninto the deepest depression of the modern world and helped to transmit\nits effects around the globe. Given all this, it is important to return the\ngold standard to the political, economic and social context of the 1920s\nso that we can fully understand its huge appeal.\n\nThe Ghost of Gold Standard Past\n\nFrom the 1870s, the German Reichsmark, the French franc and the\nUS dollar were the key currencies in the gold standard system. There\nwere many other participants, notably Russia, Canada, Belgium and\nSouth Africa, but some important countries remained outside the\nsystem, such as China, Spain and Austria-Hungary. Significantly, the\nUnited States operated according to the conventions of the gold\nstandard from 1879, joining it officially in 1900, but failed to establish\nan institution which resembled a central bank until 1913 when it set\nup the Federal Reserve System. In Europe, most, if not all, members of\nthe gold standard boasted some kind of independent central bank\nwhich spent considerable energy trying to maintain the value of the\nnational currency. Joining the gold standard made the work of the\ncentral bank easier. But although the gold standard was a \u2018system\u2019 for\nmonetary exchange, it was neither as uniform in participation nor as\nautomatic in its operation as came to be believed in the 1920s.\n\nThe defining feature of the gold standard was that the currencies of\nparticipating nations and empires were stabilized at a fixed exchange\nrate in terms of gold. This was said to be the \u2018gold content\u2019 of, for\nexample, the pound sterling, the Russian rouble or the US dollar. Gold\nwas the most appropriate monetary base because it had the reputation,\nundeserved as it turned out, for holding its value steady. From 1879\n''"

Nor was\nthere any attempt to correlate the strength ofa currency wi with the stability\nand strength of the economy in the way there is today. (Rather the gold\nvalue of a currency largely reflected the volume of gold reserves held in\ncentral banks and gold coin in circulation. |Membership of the gold\nstandard was supposed to ensure that the paper currency was convertible\ninto gold coin or gold bullion on demand, in unlimited amounts and at\na fixed price} Not only was a currency \u2018on gold\u2019 supposed to be fully\nconvertible into gold (all central banks also held foreign currency\nreserves to supplement their gold cover), currency or other valuables\nalso could be moved freely across national borders. Governments did\nnot impose regulations on the movement of money across their national\nborders. There were no exchange controls and while a country was a\nmember of the gold standard, it was possible to buy and sell its paper\ncurrency, convert it into gold and move it anywhere in the world. The\ngold standard, in effect, provided a multilateral clearing system (like a\nhuge bureau de change)which meant that money earned or borrowed\nin one country could be invested or spent somewhere else. This was an\nimportant feature of the system as countries rarely imported the same\namount as they exported to one another and it greatly facilitated the\nexpansion of international trade and investment. The total value of\ninternational trade, estimated at \u00a3800 million in 1850, reached a figure\nof around \u00a32800 million by the end of the 1870s, and rose to \u00a38000\nmillion by 1913.\n\nExchanging one national currency for another when both came with\na solid-gold guarantee removed the element of uncertainty from\ninternational currency transactions. In the international economy of\nthe nineteenth century, this had two immediate advantages. Firstly, fixed\ncurrency rates helped to stabilize prices and thereby, amongst other\nthings, simplified international trade deals. The gold standard gave\nbuyers confidence in the price agreed for a sale of goods and investors\nconfidence in their investment. Secondly, fixed exchange rates\neliminated the risk of competitive devaluation from international trade\nto make one country\u2019s exports, those from Germany, say, cheaper than\nthose of its competitors.

But in the climate of uncertainty after the First World War,\nthe fact that prices in the year 1900 were recorded as being the same\nas those of 1800 was enough to convince many that resurrecting the\ngold standard was the solution for rampant inflation and all sorts of\nother economic problems, both at home and abroad.\n\ntthe fact that the exchange rate was fixed also meant that managing\nthe exchange rate could not be an instrument of national policy. This\ndid not necessarily mean that membership of the gold standard system\nput the interests of the international economy before the national\neconomy. After all, consumers and producers alike benefited from the\nstable prices. More importantly, the automatism attributed to the system\nwas supposed to keep member countries\u2019 rates of inflation in line with\neach other. The thinking behind this assumption was first laid out by\nthe English philosopher David Hume in 1752. In his forbiddingly titled\ntheory, The Price-Specie Flow Mechanism, he argued that if a country\nexperienced a higher rate of inflation than its trading partners, its\nexternal balance of payments would slide into deficit as domestically\nproduced goods became more expensive than foreign imports. To meet\nthe resulting deficit, the country would have to both export some of its\ngold reserve, and raise interest rates to attract money from abroad.\nThis, in turn, would cause domestic money to contract and inflation to\nslow down.\n\nIn fact, economic historians now agree that there is no evidence to\nsuggest that this automatic mechanism operated in the nineteenth-\ncentury gold standard system.\\Instead, many historians\u2019 accounts as to\nwhy currencies were able to remain on gold, and the particular\ncontribution of the system to the expansion and stability of the world\neconomy, centre on the behaviour of the Bank of England and the\nstrength of the pound sterling, then the world\u2019s premier currency. One\nof the most eloquent and authoritative expositions of the British role\nas \u2018lender of the last resort\u2019 is to be found in the work of Charles\nKindleberger. \\He argues, in what has become known as the theory of\nhegemonic stability, that the smooth functioning of an open world\neconomy was dependent upon the world\u2019s leading power increasing\nthe level of its lending whenever activity in the world economy turned\ndownward. In the nineteenth century Britain fulfilled its responsibilities\nas hegemon by lubricating fluctuations in the world economy through\nits foreign loans \u2014 in 1914 Britain owned more than half of the world\u2019s\ninternational investments, a total of some \u00a34 billion.

In the 1920s the gold standard was believed to have\ncontributed greatly to the unrivalled growth in the nineteenth century\nof both the British and the international economy.\n\nHowever, as historians and economists have studied both the\noperation of the gold standard and sterling in greater depth, it has\nbecome clear that Britain alone did not \u2018manage\u2019 the world economy\nduring the latter decades of the nineteenth century. Rather, the Bank\nof England was dependent on assistance from its colleagues in other\ncentral and commercial banks, like the all-important help provided by\nthe Banque de France and the Reichsbank during the financial crises\nof 1907. When it came to managing the international economy, it was\nmore appropriate to speak of a Pax Europa than a Pax Britannica. In\ntimes of crisis, all three governments and central banks had cooperated\ntogether (sometimes other European banks were involved too), each\ndrawing on the resources of the other in order to sustain the\nconvertibility of key currencies, like the German mark and sterling, on\nthe gold standard. Their cooperation stabilized the monetary system\nand the international economy. Teamwork, not hegemonic leadership,\nwas what made the gold standard work, and as in any successful team,\nthe role of the team-captain \u2014 in this instance the Bank of England \u2014\nwas important to determine strategy and to coordinate the efforts of\nits members. In times of crisis, it was the Bank of England which\nsignalled the need for coordinated initiatives and helped to determine\nwhat those actions should be.

As we have seen, the reason for the\npostwar inflation was more complex than this. But the political and\neconomic lessons of the recent past were a powerful influence on\nEuropean governments. The gold standard offered a \u2018solid gold\u2019\nguarantee against inflation, not only because currencies held fixed\nvalues, but because participating nations had to follow an orthodox\neconomic policy to keep them there.\n\nMany of the difficulties which were to plague the operation of the\ngold standard were present in the gold standard of the nineteenth\ncentury: the absence of formal channels of cooperation, the challenge\nof determining the \u2018right\u2019 exchange rate and interest rate, the\nsubstitution of gold with foreign exchange in the reserves held by\ncentral banks. However, the difference between the title and the reality\nof the \u2018gold standard system\u2019 grew more pronounced in the\nreconstructed gold standard system of the interwar period.\n\nWhen, in 1920, politicians and financiers met together to discuss\nhow to control the inflation that was ripping through their national\neconomies, negotiations soon turned on the question of when\ngovernments would be able to return the currency to the gold standard,\nrather than whether they should. The desire to return to gold reflected\na widespread longing among the traditional arbiters of power, in\nparticular, to restore the stability, prosperity and dominance that the\nEuropean economy had enjoyed before the First World War. In fact,\nreturning to some form of fixed exchange rate system was so generally\naccepted on a national level that most of the detailed wrangling, of\nhow currencies could be returned to a stable parity and what kind of\nfixed exchange system it should be, took place only on an international\nlevel.\n\nThe first international conference to consider Europe\u2019s economic\nproblems took place at Brussels in 1920; a second was held in Genoa in\n1922. Each was a high-powered, but loosely organized meeting between\ngovernment representatives who were accountable to their respective\nnational assemblies and central bankers who were not. At the Brussels\nconference, political imperatives dominated: the United States refused\nto attend for fear that proceedings would be eclipsed by wrangling\nover war debts and reparations (they were right); the governments of\nEurope complained that without the participation of America, the one\ncountry which now controlled over 40 per cent of the world\u2019s gold and\nwas its prime source of investment capital, the conference could achieve\n''"

In other words, the big central\nbanks would try to cooperate together to help out any member currency\nthreatened by depreciation. Secondly, given the world shortage of gold,\nit was agreed that countries could top-up their gold reserves with foreign\nexchange which was itself backed by gold, like US dollars, to circumvent\nboth the world shortage of gold and to increase global liquidity. Aside\nfrom these and other technical agreements setting out the basis for\ncentral bank cooperation and international trade relations in the\nfuture, the conference delegates in Genoa stressed it was imperative\n''"

This\nhad important implications: it condemned most, if not all, European\npowers to at least two further years of inflation and it made it clear\nthat efforts to achieve currency stabilization would have to be carried\nout on a national level. In other words, it was the responsibility of each\ncountry to build up its own reserves of gold and foreign currency, to\nbring its national budget into balance, to improve its current account,\nand to identify a credible exchange rate to return their currency to\nthe gold standard and a bank rate that would keep it there.\n\nThe Weimar Republic, of course, did receive international help by\nway of the Dawes Plan. The severe capital shortage which had gripped\nthe German economy after the stabilization of the mark in November\n1923, was resolved by the successful flotation of the Dawes loan in\nAugust 1924.

The City of London, the Bank of England and the Treasury\nengaged in a concerted campaign to persuade the Chancellor of the\nExchequer, Winston Churchill, to return sterling to gold \u2018to make the\npound look the dollar in the face\u2019.\u2019 These institutions gave Churchill,\nas the senior official in the Treasury put it, \u2018irrefutable arguments to\nsupport it [the return to gold], whereas if he refused to adopt it he\nwould be faced with criticisms from the City authorities against which\nhe would not have any effective answer\u2019.* The financiers marshalled\ntheir arguments well. If sterling was not returned to gold, they argued,\nthen not only was London\u2019s status as the world\u2019s financial capital under\ngrave threat, but so, too, was British commerce (the trade in services\nlike insurance, as distinct from the sale of British manufactures).\nFurther imperial and international considerations were also powerful\ninfluences on the British government and its advisors. The Dominions,\nespecially South Africa, were guaranteed a healthy market for gold\nfrom their mining operations if Britain, the Empire and the remainder\nof Europe returned to the gold standard. Membership of the gold\nstandard club also carried the potential not only to reassert British\npower in Europe, but to improve Anglo-American relations too. From\nacross the Atlantic, successive Republican administrations had\nadvocated that all the world\u2019s major economies return to the gold\nstandard, and the persuasive interventions by the charismatic Director\nof the Federal Reserve Board, Benjamin Strong, encouraged the British\nto take this bold step. For bold it was as the British government returned\nsterling to the gold standard at the same exchange rate as before the\nwar: $4.86.\n\nBetween 1920 and 1923 the pound had fluctuated between exchange\nrates of $3.40 and $4.70. Scholars are now in broad agreement that at\n$4.86 to the pound, sterling was overvalued by around 10 per cent So\nwhy did the British government deliberately choose this overvalued\nexchange rate? The answer lies, in part, in the importance of\n\u2018credibility\u2019 to the British government in international political and\neconomic policy.

The strike illustrated both middle- and working-class\nfrustration with the levels of pay and the conditions of work for those\nin employment, and the lack of work for those without. The fact that\nthe strike was neither long-lived nor supported by the Trades Union\nCongress illustrated that British socialism, like British politics as a whole,\nwere overwhelmingly dominated by moderate politicians determined\nto preserve the economic policy to keep Britain on gold.\n\nUltimately, the decision to stabilize sterling at $4.86 was an act of\nfaith \u2014 nota blind act of faith, but a myopic one. A selective reading of\nthe \u2018lessons of history\u2019 certainly taught that the gold standard led to\nprosperity and social stability, and that inflation did not. However, the\nfailure of the British government to consider the adjustment difficulties\nposed by an overvalued exchange rate for the domestic economy was\nan important political failure, and the Treasury and the Bank of\nEngland were wrong to rule out flatly the possible benefits of\ndevaluation before restabilization, as the experience of France was to\nshow. But there is no guarantee that, even if economists and politicians\ncounselled in favour of devaluation before stabilization, the British\npublic would have tolerated it. In Denmark and Norway, for example,\nmembers of the ruling elites attempted in vain to persuade public\nopinion to devalue. They both returned to the gold standard at their\nprewar parities (so did Switzerland and the Netherlands) which\ntriggered a depression almost as severe as that to come after 1929.\n\nIt was a story repeated, with some variations, across Europe. Britain\u2019s\nreturn to the system set an important precedent. By the end of 1925,\nover 35 currencies were stabilized with most returning officially to the\ngold standard, although some, like the free city of Danzig, joined for\nthe first time.

He proclaimed that his unerring\npowers of intuition told him \u2018the fate of the regime is tied to the fate\nof the lira\u2019.\u00ae Crucially, Mussolini\u2019s decision to stabilize the lira was\nsupported by both the financial and business communities. This was,\nin part, because of the close relationship between industry and finance\nin Italy, sponsored by institutions like the Associazione fra le Societa Italiane\nper Azioni (Association of Italian Joint Stock Companies). Equally\nimportant, though, was the desire of Italy\u2019s larger industrialists to lower\ntheir costs of production and to see off their smaller competitors \u2014 big\ncompanies rightly calculated that smaller companies were likely to go\nbust under the pressure of-deflation. The extent of the lira\u2019s\novervaluation helped to turn the screw.\n\nMorgan\u2019s recent study also underlines how far the stabilization of\nthe lira expanded the role of the Partito Nazionale Fascista (Italian Fascist\nParty) in the economic life of the nation. The party\u2019s role in\nimplementing wage cuts of between 10 and 20 per cent, agreed in\nOctober 1927 and in the new price committees, the comitali\nintersindacali, to ensure price cuts in staples like pasta, rice and olive\noil to match, underlines the political implications of economic policy.\nAlthough the party was not involved in the decision to return to gold,\nMussolini relied upon it to implement the price and wage cuts\nnecessitated by the step and this gave the party an opportunity to wield\nconsiderable power at the provincial and local level.\n\nWhen countries returned their currencies to gold at an overvalued\nrate, it was not just the exchange rate that was damaging to economic\nand social stability, but the policies required to keep them there. And\nthe extent of the over- or undervaluation influenced the impact of the\npolicy regime. The point is clearly illustrated in the case of the French\nfranc. Uncoupled from gold, the franc traded at 5.45 to the dollar in\nJanuary 1919, and by January of the following year, it had slid to 12\nfrancs to the dollar.

In 1925 the return of sterling to gold at\nits prewar parity threw into sharp relief the spectacle of continued\nmonetary chaos in France.

Instead of asking, as they had in London and Rome, how much\ndeflation industry and agriculture could bear, the question was one of\nhow much inflation the French middle classes could tolerate without\nwiping out their fixed assets entirely. After six months in office, Poincar\u00e9\npegged the franc to gold in December 1926 (it returned to the gold\nstandard officially in 1928) at an exchange rate of 25.51 francs to the\ndollar and 124 francs to the pound. In other words, at an exchange\nrate 80 per cent lower than it had been in 1914. It was a decision that\nwas as good for France, at least until around 1932, as it was bad for the\nfuture health of the gold standard system.\n\nBelgium followed a similar path through depreciation and\nstabilization to that of its ally France. From 1919 to 1925, the Belgian\nbudget deficit grew like Topsy with the failure of German reparations\nto meet the costs of postwar reconstruction and with its tax system in\ndisarray. The value of the Belgian franc fell consistently, but not\nalarmingly: in May 1919 it stood at 30 francs to the pound. By May\n1925 it had fallen to 96 francs to the pound. Suddenly in the summer\nof 1926, the inflationary crisis threatened to spin out of control when\nattempts to negotiate a stabilization loan with the American bank J. P.\nMorgan failed. The Belgian franc plummeted to a new low. This,\ncoupled with the fact that the public were now heartily weary of the\ninstability, generated a new political will on the part of the three\nmainstream political parties. They joined together, with support of the\nKing, to form a Government of National Union to impose a new system\nof taxation and to cut public spending to bring the budget deficit under\ncontrol. It was now easy to secure an American loan to aid the process\nof stabilization, and after October 1926 the newly stabilized Belgian\nfranc traded at 14.5 per cent of its prewar parity.\n\nAs these examples all illustrate, when European countries \u2018chose\u2019\nthe rate at which to stabilize their currencies, they did so independently\nand with no reference to the parities adopted in other countries.

Yet the rate at which Europe\u2019s wealthiest countries\ndecided to return to gold had important consequences for other\nmembers. The stability and viability of the gold standard and the pattern\nof international trade were dramatically affected by the fact that Britain,\nDenmark, Norway and Italy were overvalued in the system while France,\nBelgium and the United States were undervalued.

In the wake of a bill\nfor reparations running into some 200 million gold crowns and\nconsiderable political conflict, Hungarian stabilization was delayed\nuntil 1925 (at 0.0069 per cent of the prewar parity) after the League of\nNations extended a loan worth some 250 million crowns.

From 1919 to 1926 government changed hands 14\ntimes, until General Pilsudski launched his successful military coup in\nMay of that year. With it came a harsh package of fiscal and financial\nmeasures to bring an end to the inflationary chaos and, despite the\nfact that Polish pretensions to democratic politics now stood in tatters,\nnational and international confidence in Pilsudski\u2019s firm leadership\nsecured a $72 million loan to facilitate stabilization of the new Polish\nzloty at a hugely devalued rate. \u2014\n\nThe Romanian drive to stabilize the leu best illustrates the\nincreasingly nationalist temper of eastern European politics. Romania,\nlike Italy, was a victor of the First World War who came to believe it was\na loser in the wake of the peace settlement. After 1919 the battle to\ncontain the inflationary pressures was exacerbated by the Romanian\ngovernment\u2019s wilful determination to stabilize the national currency\n''"

It took Romania until 1929 to stabilize its currency,\ndemonstrating the difficulty of going it alone. Its lacklustre\nperformance on currency stabilization was underlined by the equally\nunimaginative slogan: \u2018We should rely unaided on our own resources.\u2019\u2019\n\nThe way that countries, from Bulgaria in the south to Estonia in the\nnorth, struggled to achieve a stable currency, even at a vastly reduced\nexchange rate, demonstrates the difficulties most central and eastern\nEuropean economies faced (particularly when it came to agriculture)\nand the pressures brought to bear by membership of the gold standard\nsystem. Aside from Romania, the new inflow of foreign investment into\nthe region was neither as healthy nor as stabilizing as it first seemed\n(p. 84). Equally damaging were the deflationary policies that had to\nbe implemented to protect the stability of the newly stabilized\ncurrencies, for central and eastern Europe, unlike France for example,\nwas not blessed with large gold reserves or a healthy recovery in the\nlevels of trade. Aside from budget stringency on the part of government,\nit was also very expensive to borrow money in the region. The National\nBank of Austria charged a discount rate of 15 per cent while interest\non agricultural loans fluctuated between 25 and 45 per cent and, after\ncurrency stabilization in Yugoslavia, industrial and commercial firms,\nwho took out the largest loans, had to pay interest rates of around 16\nto 24 per cent. Even the most enterprising and successful of\nbusinessmen and women would struggle to make enough in profit to\npay off loans at these interest rates.\n\nThe manner in which countries returned to the gold standard,\ncoupled with the way the system operated, all stored up trouble for the\nfuture. The concluding sections of this chapter explore the implications\nof the considerable deflationary pressures to which some countries had\ncommitted themselves for individuals, interest groups and nations.\nThese are important because even when the fear of inflation began to\nease, the technical safeguards introduced to limit the freedom of central\nbanks to expand the supply of money in the economy did not. The\npolicies which accompanied gold standard membership had very\nimportant consequences for European economic growth. Even\nEuropean countries which were free from deflationary pressures \u2014\neither through devaluation as in the case of France, or non-membership\nas in the case of Spain - suffered through the interconnectedness of\nthe national, European and global economies.

In\nEurope most countries were engaged in a battle to deflate their\neconomies. If the overvaluation of the currency was large, as in the\ncase of Britain and Italy, then securing membership of the gold standard\nmarked the beginning, not the end, of a struggle to adjust the national\neconomy, by lowering prices and wages, to the international currency\nrate. The process was politically distressing and socially divisive. The\nsearch for credibility, international approval, political prestige and\ninternational capital prompted Britain, Italy and Germany to overvalue\ntheir currencies and condemn their economies to deflation. There were\nonly two ways out: to make considerable gains in productivity so that\ncosts and prices would fall, or to devalue the currency and return to\ngold at a lower exchange rate. But the whole question of devaluing\ncurrencies and then restabilizjng them on the gold standard was ruled\nout at the Genoa conference\\Thereafter, the gold standard offered no\nremedy for an overvalued exchange rate other than price or wage\ndeflation or persistent unemployment)At the time deflation seemed a\nprice worth paying for stability. For societies torn asunder by high levels\nof inflation, gold standard membership offered a gold-backed\nguarantee against repeating the experience. Although deflation was\nto exert its own pressures on the state, member nations clung to gold,\neven after 1929 when economic circumstances deteriorated so\ndramatically as to make gold standard membership, and the policies\nnecessary to maintain it, wholly inappropriate.\n\nSocial historians have been at great pains to point to the great\ndiversity of experience within class groups according to age, gender,\nlocation (urban or rural), and ethnic or religious group. But it is still\npossible, albeit crudely, to show how the experience of inflation and\ndeflation affected different groups of people in the interwar period.

However, once loss began\nto outweigh gain, then a stable currency rate in which both domestic\nand foreign investors had confidence became imperative. Deflation,\non the other hand, meant reducing costs and protecting profit margins\nby making your employees work longer hours for less pay; a strong\ncurrency, like sterling, the Reichsmark or the lira, meant you also\nenjoyed lower prices for your imports of raw materials. More\nimportantly, every European business, large or small, also faced\nrenewed competition from foreign exporters, notably from the United\nStates and France, whose exchange rates on gold were lower. Already\nfierce American competition, facilitated by new products and new\nmethods of production, received an additional boost after 1924 because\nthe dollar was undervalued in relation to many European currencies.\nIncreasingly, in the face of such strong foreign competition,\nbusinessmen across Europe began to demand that government protect\nthe home market for domestic suppliers, by way of tariffs, quotas or\nprice cartels; a trend which violated the spirit and the principles of the\ngold standard.\n\nIf you were a farmer in Europe, the experience of deflation would\nbe especially trying. Inflation enabled you to pay off your debts and to\nsecure a good price for your produce relative to industrial goods. The\ndownside was that if you had any savings, they were lost in the chaos of\nhyperinflation. Deflation was only more painful. It meant the value of\nyour produce now fell relative to manufactures (deteriorating terms\nof trade), making it much more expensive for you to buy goods for\nyour farm and home. Unlike manufacturers, you do not benefit from\ncheaper import prices as you do not need imported goods to help you\nto tend your herd or grow your crops.

But it\nneeded to have done so on a much greater scale to be able to extend\ncredit to those countries which were experiencing the gold outflow. As\nit was, the French and American failure to play by the rules made it\nmuch more difficult for countries overvalued on gold and for those\nwho were already short of gold. In effect, the Americans and the French\nwere using the gold standard as a buffer to protect their national\neconomies.\n\nThe fact that, by the end of the 1920s, France and the United States\nwere draining the world of its gold reserves (between them hoarding\nmore than half of the world\u2019s total gold supply) had a number of serious\nconsequences, both for the long-term viability of the gold standard\nand for the health of participating domestic economies. Firstly, any\ncountry that experienced an outflow of gold, because investors chose\nto sell their pounds or zlotys in favour of French francs or US dollars,\nfound their reserves of gold and foreign exchange diminishing fast \u2014\nan intolerable situation if they wanted to stay on the gold standard.\nThe drain on the national reserves forced the central bank, albeit\nreluctantly, to raise interest rates, regardless of the repercussions.

But, and this brings us onto a further flaw\nin the operation of the gold standard, from the outset, most countries\n(with the obvious exceptions of France, the United States and South\nAfrica) were very short of gold, both when it came to accumulating\nreserves in preparation for returning to the gold standard, but also\nafter they had rejoined it. Central banks across Europe struggled to\nfind gold. Instead, as we have seen, countries used foreign exchange\nto build up their reserves. However, large reserves of foreign exchange\nin place of gold, a commonplace of monetary policy at the end of the\ntwentieth century, had consequences for which central banks and\ngovernments were, in the latter 1920s, largely unprepared.\n\nTo explain: gold was never the only valuable held by central banks\nas reserves to support their currency. They held silver and other foreign\ncurrencies too, but in the nineteenth century gold reserves made up\nthe bulk of valuables in the vaults of central banks; by 1927 this was\ntrue only of the United States and France.

Sterling\nalso was a very popular choice of reserve currency in Europe as well as\nin the Empire. In the hands of continental bankers, sterling could be\nreadily exchanged for another currency, say French francs, or gold in\norder to trade, to supplement central bank reserves, or simply to make\na profit on the transaction. Therefore, when Britain wanted to\ndiscourage investors from exchanging pounds for gold or some other\nnational currency, it had to maintain competitive interest rates \u2014 usually\nthe higher the discount and interest rate, the more attractive the\ncurrency to foreign bankers and investors. This had important\nimplications for domestic investment and employment, as well as for\nstirring up ill-feeling between countries which needed to cooperate\ntogether to make the system work. At the end of 1926, for example,\nSchacht, the head of the German central bank, wished to slow down\nthe massive flow of foreign capital into Germany. Rather than lower\ndomestic discount and interest rates, he elected to convert the\nReichsbank\u2019s reserves of sterling into gold. In response, the Bank of\nEngland should have increased its interest rates in order to protect its\ngold reserves, thereby tightening money supply and, as Schacht\ncalculated, slowing down the rate of foreign investment in Germany.\nInstead, Norman, who was at the height of his powers at the Bank of\nEngland, chose to lose gold. He calculated, based on noises coming\nfrom the Treasury and the man in the street, that the political cost of\nraising interest rates at home was too great. This episode, and there\nwere others like it, illustrated that regardless of whether countries\nexperienced an inflow of foreign investment or an outflow of gold,\ncentral banks tried to minimize the impact of these flows on the\ndomestic economy. Even at this early stage in the life of the\nreconstructed gold standard, it was clear the system did not work\nautomatically, and that domestic considerations took precedence over\nthe international obligations of gold standard membership.\n\nIt was possible to paper over the cracks in the system provided that\ncountries experiencing difficulties had continued access to credit from\nthe United States and Britain. These two countries had provided the\nstabilization loans that had helped Europe back on the gold standard\nand helped to keep countries in deficit on gold by continuing to supply\nthe all important credits to bolster dwindling national reserves.

Provided that confidence in the system and in continued\neconomic growth remained, and provided that American and British\nloans continued to flow into countries running a deficit, in theory at\nleast, the reconstructed gold standard could have continued\nindefinitely.* But none of this happened automatically. From the outset,\nthe reconstructed system was dependent upon continued, close\ncooperation between the central banks of the main economic powers,\nfor if private investors did not step into fund a country\u2019s deficit, then it\nwas up to the central bankers to do so. (Leading central banks also\nsupported loans arranged by the League of Nations to central and\neastern Europe.)\n\nOne central bank could not alone save the system. If a country\nexperienced a run on its currency, then international cooperation\nbetween the world\u2019s most important bankers was essential: Governor\nNorman of the Bank of England; Benjamin Strong, governor of the\nFederal Reserve Board in New York; Emile Moreau, governor of the\nBank of France and Hjalmar Schacht of the Reichsbank. But there is\nplenty of evidence to suggest that while these staunch advocates of the\ngold standard were happy enough to extend loans to countries in order\nthat they might stabilize their economies to join the gold standard,\nthey were less willing to continue to extend credit so that a country\ncarrying a budget-deficit could remain on gold. This unwillingness only\nbecame apparent in 1928, when pressures on the gold standard, for\nreasons which will be outlined below, began to mount.\n\nEven during the supposed heyday of effective cooperation between\ncentral bankers during the 1920s, there was plenty of evidence of\ntension over policies and between personalities. In contemporary\ndocuments and diaries, Norman and Moreau, to give two prominent\nexamples, often expressed their frustration with the malfunctioning\ngold standard, and problems in international relations in general, in\nstrongly personalized terms. When they met for the first time in July\n1926, Moreau recorded the following, unflattering impression of\nNorman:\n\nHe seems to have walked out of a Van Dyck canvas: the long face, the\npointed beard, the big hat lend him the look of a companion of the\nStuarts ... He doesn\u2019t like the French. He said to me literally: \u2018I want\n''"

For them I shall do nothing.\u201d\n\nViews such as these have prompted historians to spend a great deal of\nenergy exploring how far personal friendships (like that between\nNorman and Schacht), personal animosities (between Norman and\nMoreau) and the death of the charismatic Strong in 1928 disrupted\ninternational cooperation. Personalities mattered because of the\nabsence of formalized structures to facilitate cooperation. Yet for all\nthe personal and sometimes xenophobic complaints that pepper the\nprivate records of the bankers and financiers, the records equally reveal\nthe strong commonality of aims and objectives among the central\nbankers, particularly when it came to the contribution of the gold\nstandard to economic well-being.\n\nGenuine bad feeling among the bankers was generated by differences\nin national policy, not personality. For all their claims of independence,\ncentral bankers were highly susceptible to domestic political pressure,\nand when domestic priorities diverged, international cooperation\nsuffered. True, most central bankers were free from direct government\ninterference when it came to setting the bank rate, but they tended to\nshare the world view of their governments when it came to economic\nand foreign policy. Norman\u2019s attitude towards issues like inflation, the\nsources of British economic prosperity and the French echoed the views\nof successive British cabinets and Whitehall mandarins towards, for\nexample, French reparation policy and the extension of French power\nover Germany and southeastern Europe. In fact, until the 1930s, there\nwas very little political dispute about the power wielded by central\nbankers, who were unaccountable to the public because their priorities\nchimed so precisely with those of the government. At the same time,\nbankers were increasingly sensitive to the deflationary impact of the\ninterest rate on the domestic economy. In Britain, for example, the\nbank rate was changed 18 times between May 1925 and September\n1931 (an average of three times a year). Indeed, the primacy of domestic\ninterests over international cooperation was an accepted rule of the\n\u2018sold standard game\u2019. Cooperation was only expected in so far as there\nwas no sacrifice of national interest. If this was defined broadly enough,\nthen national and international welfare begin to merge, but if national\ninterest was narrowly defined there remained little scope for\ncooperation. In the interwar period there was no international\ninstitution to act as an arbiter, however imperfect, to resolve conflicts\n''"

A good example is the textile industry that\nwas in sharp decline in Britain and Italy, but was thriving in Hungary\nand the Benelux countries. The term \u2018new\u2019 industries is best understood\nin relation to the adoption of new methods, new technologies and\nchanging markets, and the truly new industries were those which\ncombined new methods with new technologies. The best examples are\nthe motor vehicle industry, the petrochemical industry and\nmanufacturers of new products set to change life at home and at work\ndramatically \u2014 refrigerators, radios, cars, new types of office machinery\nand aeroplanes. In France, for example, the real winners in the 1920s\nwere the men and women who made artificial fibres and who refined\npetrol shipped in from oil-fields in the Middle East, an industry wrested\nfrom German control at the Paris Peace Conference that helped to\ntrigger the explosive growth of the French automobile industry. Citro\u00e9n,\nRenault and Peugeot were at the forefront of European automobile\nproduction until the 1930s, when British companies who manufactured\ncars and vans gained the upper hand in Europe.\n\nBut many of the \u2018new industries\u2019 made a difference only ata regional\nlevel, with new factories concentrated near large, urban markets around\nManchester, Liverpool, London, Paris and Berlin. Levels of production,\non the whole, remained too small in Britain and Germany to soak up\nworkers laid off from the declining, old industries, a trend reinforced\nby the new industries\u2019 preference for semiskilled or unskilled labour\nthat was generally young and often female. As the challenge of recovery\nbecame one of converting industrial resources to new methods and\ntechnologies, there were other problems. Much of European industry\nwas not adapted to produce those goods where demand was growing\nfastest and the question of change was made more complex for\nindustrialists because demand was spread over a far wider range of\ncommodities than it had been in the nineteenth century. It was also\nmuch more sensitive to the vagaries of what was to become known as\n\u2018consumer confidence\u2019.\n\nIn 1925, the picture was especially bleak in Britain as far as the \u2018old\u2019\nindustries were concerned. Although world output in iron and steel\nbegan to rise that year, technical backwardness and high prices helped\nto push nearly half of British pig-iron capacity and three-fifths of its\nsteel-making capacity into idleness.

Inertia characterized the\nresponse of industrialists and government to the problems of replacing\nmachinery, modernizing methods of production and whether industries\nshould be relocated; the fact that gold standard membership pushed\nup the cost of investment did not help. Yet, it was not until the late\n1920s that doubts about the long-term future of heavy industry in\nEurope were being voiced on both a national and an international\nlevel.\n\nIn France and in Belgium the picture was more complex. With much\nof their heavy industry destroyed or damaged in the war, reconstruction\nwas the first order of business, a challenge greatly facilitated by the\ninflation that had eased the burden of national debt and encouraged\ninvestment. By 1925 the French government had processed around\nthree million claims for assistance and had helped to rebuild roads,\nrailways, factories and mines. As in Belgium, the government took the\nopportunity of reconstruction to modernize and mechanize many of\nits working mines \u2014 300 coalmines now included new electrically\npowered equipment. But almost 8000 of the French factories rebuilt\nwith government aid were simply restored to their original state. By\ndefault more than design, the French government rejected the\nopportunity to effect a throughgoing modernization of European-style\nfactories that were comparatively small, labour-intensive and family\nbased. Across western Europe textile centres, still largely an artisan\nindustry in countries like Germany and France, continued to be hard-\nhit, unable to compete with foreign competitors who employed new\nmethods and offered new products and cheaper prices.\n\nIn Belgium the restabilization of the currency in 1926 (at an exchange\nrate somewhat higher than that of the French franc) triggered a\nslowdown in the rate of economic recovery, but the signs still appeared\ngood. By 1927 Belgian pig-iron production was half as large again as it\nhad been in 1913. In France and Belgium industrial production\ncontinued to grow strongly from 1928 until well into 1930.

The emergence of\nindustrial cartels in the 1920s was a good example of how change had\nboth good and bad effects on the European economy. In an effort to\ncope with the changing composition of global demand, the pressure\nfor productivity and foreign (especially American) competition,\nEuropean manufacturers, particularly in the west, sought to eliminate\ninefficiencies by forming large-scale production and trading units and\nby setting up price cartels (p. 183). This became known as the\n\u2018rationalization mania\u2019 and it sponsored some of the leading industrial\nmergers of the era: the creation of Vereinigte Stahlwerke (United Steel\nWorks) and I. G. Farben in Germany, the Imperial Chemical Company\n(ICI) in Britain, the French metallurgical and armaments concern\nSchnieder based at Le Creusot and the Czech iron and steel\nconglomerate Prodejna sdrueznych ceskoslovenskych zelezaren (Selling\nAgency of the United Czechoslovak Iron Works). The difficulties in\nevaluating whether these kind of mergers were beneficial are enormous.\nThe high degree of economic organization, for example, helped to\nease the transition from one set of technologies to another (evident in\nthe chemical and steel industries). It also offered greater opportunities\nto control the workforce and advantages through the economies of\nscale. The downside was that \u2018rationalization\u2019 also skewed patterns of\ninvestment and shielded some uncompetitive companies from the\npressure to modernize until it was too late.\n\nThe patchy nature of Europe\u2019s recovery in the 1920s was underlined\nby the comparatively high levels of working-class unemployment,\nalthough France was a notable exception. In Britain, unemployment\naveraged one million throughout the period. In Germany, too,\nunemployment never fell below a million after 1925. The figures for\nScandinavia were even more dramatic.

The issue remains controversial, but Balderston\u2019s recent\nwork argues that while wages for workers in the Weimar Republic\ncontinued to rise after the restabilization of the mark in November\n1923, increased pay-levels were matched by increases in the amount\nproduced by each worker. (Wage rises were also triggered by labour\nshortages as certain types of skilled labour were in short supply in most\nEuropean economies.) In Britain, however, early studies point to a\ndifferent conclusion. There is evidence that British wage rises were\nnot matched by commensurate gains in productivity and workers were\nless sensitive to the problems confronting employers who were anxious\nto become more competitive.\n\nEconomists have also explored whether unemployment benefits,\nintroduced in many countries for the first time during this period,\nserved to encourage unemployment. Throughout the 1920s, successive\nadministrations of the United States, where the unemployed had to\nrely on charities for help, certainly considered western European levels\nof benefit far too generous. So far, there is very little evidence to support\nclaims that state benefits encouraged joblessness because the sums paid\nin state unemployment insurance were not enough to prompt workers\nto opt for unemployment benefit over regular work. But unemployment\ninsurance was a burden on economic recovery in other ways. Most\nimportantly, programmes of government assistance were a persistent\ndrain on the state budget. This did not just raise painful political issues\nof increasing taxes and deciding who to collect them from: if the\ncountry in question was a member of the gold standard, a persistent\nstate deficit threatened the government\u2019s entire monetary strategy. It\nwas no coincidence that the looming budgetary crisis in Germany in\n1927 came at the same time as the Reichstag passed a drastically\nunderfunded unemployment insurance scheme. Within four years, the\ndeficit on this one account would claim over 14 per cent of all taxes\ncollected by the Reich and the Lander put together. In Germany the\nburden of social spending had profound implications for currency\nstability and the continued flow of credit into the country.\n\nAnalysts at the League of Nations were more impressed by the very\nhigh levels of industrial growth achieved in central and eastern Europe\nduring this period than by the recovery of the west. Between 1925 and\n1929, manufacturing grew by over 26 per cent in Czechoslovakia, 48\nper cent in Hungary, 36 per cent in Poland, and 48 per cent in Romania,\nwhile Bulgaria\u2019s rate of growth was the highest in the Danubian region.\n''"

It was hard for the west not to notice that the most substantial\nindustrial growth in the east was in industries traditionally considered\nthe strongest in western Europe: coal, iron and steel, cement, oil\nproduction, raw material extraction and food production. Modern-\nization, where it happened, produced some startling gains in\nproductivity; in British coal mines output per shift rose by only 14 per\ncent between the wars compared to 54 per cent in Poland, although\nmines in the Ruhr and in the Netherlands became more productive by\n81 per cent and 118 per cent respectively.\n\nBut for the most part, with the exception of Czechoslovakia, the\nregion struggled to match developments in new methods of production\nand factory layout, in business organization, in rationalization and in\nexploiting new sources of energy. Firms in central and eastern Europe\nalso found it hard to specialize in producing select lines of quality\nproducts because most goods manufactured east of Germany were sold\nat home and the domestic market was fairly underdeveloped. Instead,\nfirms opted to produce a variety of mediocre products. In Hungary,\nfor example, the iron and steel factories have been described as \u2018general\nstores\u2019 because they produced so many items in such small quantities.\nHere, as in the west, the influx in foreign investment was important,\nbut, continuing the prewar trend, the state also continued to take a\nprominent role in developing the economy. It encouraged industry by\nsubsidies, import controls, tax relief schemes, high tariffs and export\nbounties. The higher levels of state intervention in the economies of\nthe east did not always help, for government policies often lacked\ncoherence and consistency. In Romania, for example, any business\nemploying more than 25 workers, or with a power capacity of more\nthan five horsepower, was entitled to tax exemptions, railway subsidies\nand free access to around 5 hectares of land for 90 years. The scheme\ndid not address the real needs of Romanian industry and, because it\nwas indirectly protectionist, also generated new problems.\n\nNeither state intervention, nor foreign investment had a wholly\nbeneficial impact on the development of central and eastern European\neconomies. As in the Weimar Republic, foreign investment was often\nsquandered on projects designed to impress \u2014 munitions production\nand fancy construction projects (p. 89). But most damaging to its\nprospects of continued growth were the persistent troubles of the\nprimary industries.\n''"

Here\nthe year 1925 did not mark a turning point in the difficulties which\nhad plagued the agrarian sector since the end of the First World War:\ncompetition from producers in the Americas remained fierce, levels\nof productivity failed to improve and in some regions, notably the\nBalkans, yields of the most important crops were down by as much as\n13 per cent. What was needed, scholars have argued since, were policies\ndesigned to reform the pattern of landholding and to improve methods\nof agricultural production to make eastern and southern European\nagriculture as intensive as farming in northern Europe and in Canada\nand the United States. But, if anything, the determination of eastern\nEuropean statesmen to \u2018modernize\u2019 their countries led them to give\npriority to industry over agriculture.\n\nThe situation in Poland was bleak and typical of the problem. Many\nlandholdings were simply too small, with only 17 per cent of the peasant\npopulation owning farms adequate to earn a livelihood. In 1931 the\ncensus in Yugoslavia listed two-thirds of all farms as measuring less than\n5 hectares \u2014 the minimum necessary to sustain a peasant family. In the\neast, Czechoslovakia alone recorded consistent improvements in its\nyield from 1913 to 1929. Here the state successfully intervened to reform\nthe pattern of landholding and offered technical and financial\nassistance to farmers who modernized their farms and concentrated\non more profitable produce, like sugar-beet. Elsewhere, however, many\npeasant farmers, despite the hardships they faced, were often opposed\nto new techniques and mechanization, and methods of farming\nremained remarkably static. Such problems were not confined to the\neast. Patterns of agricultural production in southern and, to a lesser\nextent, western Europe (as in France) were also behind in relation to\ncompetitors in North America, but agricultural backwardness was a\nmuch more serious issue for eastern Europe because of the economy's\nreliance on agriculture.\n\nIn much of central, eastern and southern Europe, the condition of\nagriculture came to dominate the political agenda. European farmers\nfaced common problems that had important implications not just for\ntheir own well-being \u2014 farmers in Italy, for example, found their civil\nliberties constrained by government policies designed to stop the rural\nunemployed from migrating to the cities \u2014 but also for the health of\n''"

In the 1920s the region\u2019s problems were much the same as\nthey had been before the war: the dominance of peasant self-sufficiency\nin smallholdings; overpopulation; primitive production techniques; low\ncapital accumulation accompanied by high levels of indebtedness; and\nhigh interest rates. It all added up to very low levels of efficiency and\nhelped to make life as a farmer a hard and precarious existence.\n\nLife as a tenant farmer was little better. Levels of productivity on\nthese farms were somewhat higher, particularly on the large estate farms\nin Catalan Spain. But tenant farmers here, like their counterparts in\nsouthern Italy, had grown to resent these traditional patterns of\nlandholding that milked them of their labour without enabling them\nto enjoy the benefits of owning their own land. The large estate farms\nin Spain were run on a factory-style system, and employers, with the\nexcuse of a competitive marketplace for their produce, were able to\nkeep wages close to starvation levels because of the large pool of\nunemployed labour. Throughout the 1920s in Spain, agrarian unrest\nwas widespread and sometimes erupted into localized conflicts or \u2018civil\nwars\u2019, contributing in the long run, of course, to the civil war that\nengulfed all of Spain in 1936.\n\nThere were bright spots in primary production. Farmers who\nswitched to fruit, vegetable and/or animal production, and away from\ncereals, found themselves considerably better off. So, too, did those\nwho opted to cooperate with each other. Danish agricultural\ncooperatives provided a model emulated by countries like Estonia and\nLatvia. Farmers in the Baltic republics became, like their Danish\ncounterparts, particularly successful at exporting butter and bacon.\nEven more impressive was the strong demand for industrial raw\nmaterials, like Romanian oil and Yugoslavian metal ores, with exports\nrising very rapidly until around 1928. Tobacco and forestry production\nalso grew increasingly important to the region \u2014 by 1926 one-third of\nBulgaria\u2019s export earnings came from tobacco.\n\nBut the variety of new goods produced for export in eastern Europe\ncould be counted on the fingers of one hand, and most of these were\nraw materials or agricultural products. Around three-quarters of all\nexports from eastern Europe were commodity exports; as so often,\nCzechoslovakia was a notable exception with only one-third of its\nexports taken up with the primary products.

The problems of oversupply in world cereal\nproduction, already evident in the immediate aftermath of the war,\nespecially when it came to wheat, continued unabated throughout the\n1920s. The world was awash with wheat. Between 1924 and 1929, world\nwheat output rose by almost 17 per cent above the 1909-14 average,\nyet consumption rose by only 11 per cent. For eastern Europe\n(excluding Russia) the news was even worse, for its proportion of the\nworld\u2019s wheat export market declined in relative and absolute terms:\nfrom 1909 to 1913 cereal exports from the region had averaged 8\nmillion tons a year, but from 1925 to 1929 they stood at only 0.61 million\ntons.\n\nEven without this bad news, much of central, eastern and southern\nEurope was already in trouble, with the threat of more on the way,\nbecause of its overdependence on the international commodity market\nand the inflow of international credit. Commodity markets were\nnotoriously volatile, largely because demand for agricultural goods\nremained quite constant. Any sudden changes in supply, such as the\nvery good harvest of 1927, had a very dramatic (downward) effect on\nprices. This vulnerability was reinforced by the fact that most countries,\nin eastern Europe in particular, were heavily dependent on the\nproduction and export of one or two key commodities. All it took was\nthe price of tobacco to fall on the international market, as it did in\n1926, and the whole economic, financial and political stability of an\nentire country, in this case Bulgaria, was called into question.\n\nLife grew increasingly difficult for eastern European farmers, in\nparticular, but it is important to remember that all of Europe was\nadversely affected by increased international competition in the\ninternational commodities markets and changing patterns of demand.\nBetween 1925 and 1929, raw material prices fell by 18.8 per cent and\nfood prices by 14.1 per cent (1923-29), while the price of manufactured\ngoods fell by only 10.7 per cent. The fact that the terms of trade had\nshifted against farmers by around some 5 per cent, made it increasingly\ndifficult for eastern Europe to pay for imports, such as industrial\nmachinery, which were essential if it was to modernize, to diversify,\nand thereby to strengthen its economy. The collapse of primary prices,\nalso made it difficult to pay off debts, both at home and abroad.\n\nThe political turmoil which racked eastern Europe in the 1920s,\ndestroying virtually all traces of democracy by the end of the decade\n(again, Czechoslovakia was the exception), is eloquent testimony to\nthe impact of the agrarian crisis on politics.

But these links could become a source of weakness if the\neconomy of the west should turn downwards, particularly given that\nthe poor country cousins to the south and east had little diplomatic or\neconomic leverage to persuade the wealthy countries to keep their\nmarkets open in the face of domestic pressure for trade protectionism.\n\nRising Protectionism\n\nDuring the 1920s, despite the lofty rhetoric of returning to the prewar,\nalbeit largely mythical, freedom of unregulated trade, European\ngovernments succumbed to political pressure and gradually\nreintroduced protectionist measures. Primary producers demanded\nprotection in the face of falling prices and the fear that cheap imports\nfrom the Americas and the Far East would be dumped on already\nvulnerable markets. Across Europe political pressure led to the\nimposition of tariffs, import quotas and other, more indirect, forms of\nassistance by way of subsidies and sanitary restrictions (prohibitions\nmade on \u2018health\u2019 grounds). Moreover, when traditional party politics\nand methods failed to meet farmers\u2019 demands for protection and\nrecovery, farmers were drawn to political parties which proclaimed a\nspecial national role for those who tilled the soil. In the 1920s,\nincreasing frustration with the new interest group politics encouraged\nmany in farming communities to support fascist parties, who claimed\nthat conflicts of interests (between industry and agriculture) could be\novercome and that all groups in society could and should work together\nto build a strong national economy. As Hitler asserted, he wanted to\nlead \u2018not a class party, but a party of honest producers\u2019.*\n\nThere was a growing realization on the part of government, regardless\nof its political complexion, that agriculture was not like other industries.\nFor one thing, it was more difficult for farmers than industrialists to\nrespond to changing patterns of demand because it took several years\nto switch from one product to the next; for another, it was clear that,\non an individual basis, Europe\u2019s farmers were helpless in the face of\nmarket disequilibrium, and more particularly, the growing disparity\nbetween industrial and agricultural prices.

France was far from perturbed, for it had already reintroduced\na moderate degree of protection in 1919, reinforced it in 1926, and\nthen, in the context of a commercial agreement with Germany in 1927,\nrevised and extended its quotas and tariffs. Norway, too, introduced\nmeasures to protect its farmers and lumberjacks that year. But it was\nthe Italian tariff, made law in 1922 to inhibit Italy\u2019s \u2018overdependence\u2019\non foreign grain imports as part of the fascist Mussolini\u2019s nationalist\n\u2018Battle for Wheat\u2019, that pointed to the potent fusion of agricultural\ncrisis and nationalism that was to grip first eastern, and then central\nEurope in the decade to come.

New customs tariffs were introduced in Austria, although, in\ndeference to the notion of free trade that had governed economic\nrelations within the former empire, the levels of protection remained\ncomparatively low. By spring 1925, tariffs were implemented in Hungary\nand Yugoslavia. Here protectionist barriers were set at much higher\nlevels than before the First World War. Hungary\u2019s prewar tariff had\nbeen 20 per cent, after 1925 it stood at 30 per cent; Yugoslavian\nprotective tariffs were raised from their former level of around 10 per\ncent to stand at between 20 per cent and 26 per cent on agricultural\ngoods, rising to between 70 per cent and 170 per cent on industrial\nproducts. The most dramatic tariff hikes came in Bulgaria and Romania\nwhere effective tariff rates were increased to between 50 per cent and\n300 per cent, with a prohibitive tariff barrier raised in every field that\ndomestic industry was active. Even Czechoslovakia succumbed to the\ntrend after the election victory of the Agrarian party in 1925.\n\nAt a time when agricultural exporters were increasingly desperate\nto sell at almost any price, tariff hikes were not enough to protect the\ndomestic market from cheap foreign imports. The 1920s witnessed the\nemergence of new and increasingly inventive forms of indirect\nprotectionism.

A large number of European countries,\nnotably Germany and France, regarded unconditional MFN as\nsomething that had to be bargained for and did not accept the clause\nas a general principle of policy.

The Netherlands, Switzerland, Czechoslovakia and\nSweden exported more modest amounts of capital.\n\nThe amounts invested in central and eastern Europe, in particular,\nwere enormous, with Germany receiving over $4 billion \u2014 some 50 per\ncent of the total inflow into Europe. Austria and Italy together received\naround $1.5 billion, while Romania, Poland, Hungary and Greece also\nbetween them secured around $1.5 billion. Without going into too\nmuch detail regarding the different types of investment, it is significant\nto note the tremendous growth of short-term in relation to long-term\ninvestment in Europe. Short-term loans made up 55 per cent of the\ninvestment entering Germany and 37 per cent of the monies entering\nthe remainder of central and eastern Europe. This was important\nbecause, once financiers began to doubt the wisdom of their loans and\nwhether the debtor nations of Europe would continue to be able to\nservice the debts, it was much easier to curtail their commitments to\nEurope than if the investments had been made on a long-term basis.\n\nDuring the 1920s Europe had grown increasingly dependent on\nforeign loans to sustain economic growth and monetary stability. There\nwere nationalists who claimed that their country had no use for foreign\ncapital. But the low level of domestic savings and the like meant that\ndomestic banks (inflation and hyperinflation seriously undermined\npublic confidence in banks) had precious little capital, far less than\nthey had before the war, to invest in the economy. Take the example of\nHungary. In 1914, domestic capital accumulation averaged around 10\nper cent; after the war, the average was closer to 5 per cent of net\nnational product. (Even before the war, economic growth had only\ntaken place thanks to substantial injections of foreign capital.) Estimates\nsuggest the shortage of capital in the Balkan countries was even worse.\nIt meant that foreign creditors could obtain rates of interest of between\n20 per cent and 25 per cent on any investment made in the Balkans\nand so foreign capital seeped in to fill the gap left by the collapse of\ndomestic loans. In Poland the ratio of domestic to foreign capital was\n4:6, with foreign participation in Yugoslavia and Hungary even higher.\nBut as in the Weimar Republic, the inflow of capital did not necessarily\nstrengthen national economic performance.\n\nExamples of poor investment abound in agricultural Europe as the\npoverty and traditional attitudes of the peasantry meant it was easier\nto obtain investment than to put it to good use.

In Romania\none-third of foreign investment was spent on the civil service and on\nprojects dedicated to generating prestige. Matters were no better\nelsewhere in the east. It has been calculated that of the $604.6 million\ninvested in Hungary, Bulgaria, Yugoslavia and Poland on a short- and\nlong-term basis, over half was used to finance an import surplus of\ngoods and services, one-tenth was used to purchase gold (duties\nperformed as part of gold standard membership), while the remaining\ntwo-fifths were used up servicing outstanding loans. In the case of\nEstonia, the figures made even worse reading: over 70 per cent of the\nforeign capital went straight back out again to service its loans. Not\nonly did this foreign credit largely fail to make these economies more\nproductive, servicing the loans meant that earnings from agricultural\nexports were also diverted from productive use. Hard-earned foreign\ncurrency was spent on loan payments when it could have been used to\nbuy new machinery for industry and agriculture that would have made\na genuine contribution to the task of modernization.\n\nThe need to service burgeoning levels of international indebtedness\nalso triggered more protectionist policies that were not in Europe's\nbest interests in the long run. The failure of foreign investments made\nafter 1924 to self-liquidate (in other words, profits made from\ninvestments were insufficient to pay off the loan) meant that foreign\ndebt absorbed a steadily increasing proportion of eastern Europe\u2019s\nprecious export earnings. By 1928 external payments on such debts\nswallowed up around 40 per cent of the capital flowing into Hungary\nand 28 per cent of the money entering Poland. In order to meet these\npayments, countries attempted to boost exports, but this proved\ndifficult. When the strategy failed, European governments increasingly\nresorted to tariffs and quotas to limit imports, and thereby protect\nforeign exchange needed to defend gold convertibility and to service\ntheir debts. International trade, as ever, was vital to the well-being of\nthe debtor countries of Europe because it helped to pay off loans that,\nin turn, encouraged fresh foreign investment into Europe.\n\nIn short the inflow of foreign capital into Europe had helped to\ndisguise, but not effectively treat, the maladies of European industry\nand agriculture, and problems in the operation of the gold standard.\nThe cracks in the facade began to show in 1927, when the levels of\nforeign capital entering Europe dropped sharply.

Why? In large measure,\nof course, it was because the reality of Europe\u2019s patchy record of\nindustrial growth in general, and the persistent problems of the\nagricultural sector in particular, made it increasingly unlikely that\ndebtors would be able to pay back what they had borrowed. As foreign\ninvestors themselves had come to realize, the fact that European debtors\nwere prepared to pay high rates of interest did not reflect their real\nability to pay off their debts, and the whole cycle of indebtedness was\nnow serving only to weaken the prospects for economic growth. Indeed,\nthe rising level of protectionism was symptomatic both of the problems\nfacing the European economy and a reason why it would be so difficult\nto tackle these problems.\n\nAs the levels of investment fell away, the debtor nations in Europe\ndid not just look to their own backyards for the source of their renewed\ntroubles. An accusatory finger was also pointed at the largest source of\ntheir capital, the United States. At the same time as America had\nbecome the largest foreign lender, it had also become a significant\nimport market taking in more than 12 per cent of the world\u2019s total\nimports, the majority of which were primary products. The interaction\nbetween American investment flowing out and foreign imports flowing\nin was essential. European debtors needed access to American markets\nto earn US dollars to make payment on war debts and commercial\ndebts (and, indirectly, reparations) to their American creditors. But\nby the end of the 1920s, the falling prices of agricultural goods had\ntriggered new protectionist barriers around the United States. (We have\nseen how the agricultural depression fostered the same trend within\nEurope.) The development made it clear to European producers that\nthe American \u2018Open Door\u2019 increasingly swung open only to let\nAmerican exports out, and exhibited a growing tendency to swing shut\nwhen it came to letting foreign imports, particularly agricultural ones,\ninto the United States. The situation was vividly summed up by B.

But by 1930, many of the\nproblems already evident in European agriculture in the preceding\ndecade now took hold with a vengeance. It took a while, however, for\npolicy-makers, and society as a whole, to recognize the magnitude of\nthe crisis that confronted them. The early policy response to the\neconomic downturn only worsened matters. The lessons of history were\na vital force in shaping the way European governments understood\nthe onset of the depression and informed their policy response to it.\nOne of the most striking features of the period as a whole, was the way\nthe \u2018golden twenties\u2019 continued to be identified as the decade of\ninflation, when, for the most part, it had been a decade of deflation.\n\nThe \u2018Special Case\u2019 of Germany\n\nThe collapse of the Weimar economy at the end of the 1920s, lays bare\nmany of the problems in the way that capital operated in both the\ndomestic and international economy, and the relationship between\nthese two levels. The role of foreign credit in the German economy\nhas come in for particular scrutiny by historians for a number of\nreasons. First, the republic received the largest amount of the foreign\nmonies entering Europe in the 1920s; second, the severity of the\neconomic depression in Germany was, next to the USA, the most acute\nof any industrialized economy in the world. Third, as one of the\ncontinent\u2019s largest economies, the health of the German nation was\nvital to the well-being of the whole. Fourth, and most compelling of\nall, was the close correlation between the collapse of the economy and\npopular support for the German National Socialist Party (NSDAP)\nwhich, by January 1933, was to see the end of the republic and the first\nsigns of German economic recovery.

Rather than use it to\nmodernize plants and products and to improve productivity, foreign\ncapital was often used simply to effect industrial mergers \u2014 the steel\nindustry is a classic example. Harold James is certainly dismissive of\nthe German rationalization movement, arguing that \u2018modernity took\nplace on the cinema screen and in the novel, but on the whole not in\nthe German workplace.\u2019* This view has been challenged recently by\nMary Nolan, who argues that the effects of rationalization in German\nindustry were not so much insignificant as contradictory. In either case,\novercapacity in German industry remained a considerable problem\nuntil the mid-1930s. Even the German automobile industry, which was\none of the most rationalized and productive industries, had to work\nhard to compete. The German car industry was divided between an\nefficient sector and a host of small producers who had to work hard to\nbuild inexpensive cars for a mass market. As a result, Germany came\nan embarrassing eighth when it came to the world index of car\nownership per head of population, behind America, Britain, France,\nDenmark, Sweden, Switzerland and Belgium. Many historians have also\nbeen critical of the large amounts of foreign investment spent on\nbuilding and public transportation projects to modernize civic life and\nmaintain social peace; sports stadiums and swimming pools, exhibition\nhalls, underground systems in Hamburg and Berlin, airfields and tram\nnetworks. These projects brought political, social and cultural benefits,\nalthough they have proven more difficult to measure.\u201d Indeed, the trend\nwas not confined to Germany. Municipal authorities in Britain spent\ncomparable amounts on public works.\n\nThe governments of creditor countries, notably successive Republican\nadministrations in the United States, were not oblivious to the risks\nbeing taken by American investors who chose to put their money into\nGermany. So why did the American government fail to reduce the\nvolume of dollars entering the Weimar Republic? The explanation lies\nfirst and foremost in the fact that these were private loans. The\nAmerican government relied upon private bankers to follow its\nrecommendation to extend loans for \u2018reproductive [sic] purposes only\u2019\nand to refrain from lending to German municipalities. Yet determining\nwhether a loan was likely to be productive was \u2018not a subject for\nmathematical determination [but] largely a matter of opinion\u2019.* The\nRepublicans had neither the political will nor the legal power to\nintervene directly in what were private transactions between investor\n''"

Although levels of unemployment fell to 7 per cent in\n1925, they rose to 18 per cent the following year. By 1927 they dipped\nagain to around 8 per cent and 9 per cent but then, in the final months\nof 1928, began an ascent which became unprecedented and did not\nstop until the spring of 1933. For historians of the Weimar Republic,\nthe evidence of persistent and serious weaknesses in the German\ndomestic economy prior to October 1929 has important implications\nfor the heated debate as to whether the Weimar Republic was doomed\nlong before the onset of the Great Depression. As we have seen, of all\nthe European powers, Weimar experienced the greatest range of\nindustrial, agricultural, monetary and political problems in the 1920s:\nconstitutional challenges, high levels of state spending and a crisis of\nlegitimacy. The republic was trapped in a low-growth economy that\nmade it highly vulnerable to a new downturn after 1929.\n\nIt is now clear that Germany\u2019s slide into depression began as early as\n1928, for it was then that output began to decline and investment in\nthe economy began to dry up. Historians now largely agree that many\nof the short- as well as long-term causes of the decline were domestic.\nOne of the first things to fail was business confidence, in the wake of\nrenewed wrangling over the state budget and the threat of further tax\nincreases to hit employer and employee alike.

(It triggered\na crisis in the price of stocks and shares that did not recover until the\nend of the depression.) In 1928, as part of the effort to cool down the\nmarket for foreign credit in Germany, the Weimar government led by\nHermann Miller withdrew tax concessions enjoyed by foreign investors\nand this, combined with the now miserable economic climate, led to a\nserious decline in foreign investment.\n\nThe close link between the economic health and political viability\nof the republic was underlined by the consequences of these economic\ndevelopments for political life.

By 1929 many regional and municipal governments,\nsuch as those of Berlin and Cologne, were facing bankruptcy. Indeed,\nfalling levels of economic activity and employment only made the\nbudget deficits grow larger. The relationship is clearest at the national\nlevel. Every year from 1925 to 1932, the Reich ran a budget deficit. In\nitself, this was not unusual and the deficits generally were not large.\nBut the damage done to the German capital market by the\nhyperinflation, alongside the legal restrictions placed on regional and\nnational budgets and on the operations of the Reichsbank, made it\nvery difficult to finance even small amounts of government debt. History\nplayed a central role in the growing conviction that the Weimar\neconomy was in serious trouble. The confidence of German investors\nhad been badly battered by the republic\u2019s history of revolution,\nreparations, hyperinflation and sluggish economic growth. Moreover,\nthe foreign investment, which had helped Weimar to acheive recovery\nafter 1924, was now increasingly seen as a source of weakness rather\nthan strength. There was a growing conviction, at home and abroad,\nthat the Weimar Republic was carrying far more debt than it could\never pay off. As a consequence, the volume of German investment in\nthe German economy fell off rapidly after 1927.\n\nIn 1927 and 1928 two developments helped to cover up the fact that\nthe Weimar Republic was running out of cash and out of time. The\nfirst was a sharp rise in interest rates. As the logic of gold standard\nmembership demanded, rising budget deficits helped to trigger a\nfurther increase in Germany\u2019s already high interest rates. Although\nthe interest rate hike tightened the monetary vice around the German\neconomy, it also revived the flow of foreign credit into Germany and,\nsuperficially at least, this foreign capital continued to lubricate the\notherwise jolting performance of the German economy into the middle\nof 1928. The reinstatement of tax concessions to foreign investors also\nhelped. Beneath the surface, however, the renewal of foreign loans\nonly exacerbated the problems the nation was to face thereafter, for\nmost of the loans surging into German banks, and from there on to\nGerman industry, were made on a short-term basis only. The trend had\nnumerous political and economic implications. As the Treasurer of\nthe City of Cologne explained to its Mayor, Konrad Adenauer: \u2018We will\nthus have to make do with further short-term credits for all the fixed\nexpenditures. But, as you can see by looking at the example of\nDusseldorf that could lead ...

It was\na mark of growing international concern about the stability of the\nGerman capital market, as well as renewed international tension over\nthe Allied occupation of the Rhineland. In1929 the brains behind the\nDawes Plan, Owen Young, the Chairman of General Electric, tabled\nthe new scheme, soon dubbed the Young Plan. The scheme attempted\nto reconcile Allied demands for reparations, German reluctance to\npay them, and the United States\u2019 unchanging determination to collect\nthe \u2018hired money\u2019 extended to its allies in the First World War. In it\nGerman reparations were reduced once again and new credit\narrangements were established. The tone of the negotiations was\ndifficult \u2014 typical was the acerbic comment of the French journalist\nPierre Hamp: \u2018America declares a plan the way Germany declared war\u2019.\u00ae\nThe misplaced American optimism that the Young Plan would revive\nUS loans soon evaporated in the face of the global economic collapse\nafter 1929. Significantly, the former European allies and the German\ndelegates, in a special arrangement made outside the terms of the\nreport, agreed that German reparations would be scaled down if and\nwhen the former allied powers secured any reduction or cancellation\nof war debts from the United States. The development was an indication\nof the deterioration of relations between debtors and creditors that\nwas to come after 1929. It also raised the spectre of a \u2018united front\u2019 of\nEuropean debtors to provoke the ire of the American people and the\nRepublican administration. In the long run, the sole positive\ncontribution of the Young Plan was to establish the Bank of\nInternational Settlements (BIS) in Geneva to provide a much-needed\nagency for international cooperation amongst the central banks \u2014 its\nother function, to receive and to disburse reparations, remained\nunfulfilled.\n\nIn the autumn of 1929, while talks regarding the Young Plan were\nstill under way, events took a worrying turn with a new fall in the amount\nof foreign investment entering Germany and the collapse of the\n''"

By 1931 these two events were\nseen to have heralded the beginning of the world\u2019s economic crisis.\nBefore going on to consider whether this was so, it is important to\nnote the apparent link between the reparations and the incipient\neconomic depression. The fact that the negotiations for the Young Plan\nwere still under way when the American stock market fell so\nspectacularly, coupled with the monetary history of the 1920s, left\nGermany well-placed to exploit the widespread perception that\nreparations had done irreparable harm to the German economy.\nDespite the complex and largely domestically generated causes of the\nslump that was to grip Germany after 1930, in the eyes of the German\npublic it was internationalism in general, and reparations in particular,\nthat were to blame for the crisis. After December 1929, public hostility\nto the Young Plan, and its association with the rapidly deteriorating\nhealth of both the German and global economy, translated into\nsignificant support for political extremists, notably Adolf Hitler. The\npopulist message that reparations were to blame for all Germany\u2019s woes\nwas an easy and seductive one. In the wake of the banking crisis in the\nsummer of 1931, the argument gained increasing acceptance outside\nGermany too, and, as we shall see, came to dominate much of the\ninternational diplomatic efforts to tackle the economic crisis.\n\nThe respite provided by the revival of international lending to\nGermany in the first half of 1928 proved to be temporary. In 1929 the\nonce mighty stream of foreign investment into Weimar became a trickle,\nand then, in 1930, pretty much dried up altogether. For Europe as a\nwhole, with the notable exceptions of Sweden and France, the problem\nwas no less serious. In 1927 and 1928 the volume of foreign capital\ninvested in Europe stood at around $1.7 billion a year. In 1929 it\ndropped to $1.0 billion and fell to less than half that figure by 1930.\nWhy such a dramatic turn of events? What had changed was not so\nmuch the reality of the economic situation in Europe, as it was\nperceptions of that reality. The patchy record of Europe\u2019s economic\nperformance since the war had finally caught up with it. In the summer\nof 1929, all sorts of indicators revealed the economy was in decline. It\nwas clear the crisis in agriculture was getting worse, not better, and\nthat the problems in industrial performance had not been resolved by\ninward investment. The growing perception that Europe was entering\na period of recession caused the confidence of foreign investors to\nturn to anxiety in the face of the enormous accumulation of European\ndebt and the apparently dwindling ability of countries, especially\n''"

The loss of confidence\nwas reflected in the fact that most loans to Germany in 1929 were made\nonly on a short-term basis. This development merely made things worse:\nthe more the short-term debt increased, the greater the perceived threat\nto German stability, and the scarcer foreign credit became. As events\nduring 1930 and 1931, in particular, made clear, this short-term\nborrowing laid the Weimar Republic open to financial pressure at\nmoments when it was most vulnerable. Any political disputes about\ntaxation increases, government spending cuts and paying public\nservants also had an impact on Germany\u2019s financial health. The Weimar\nRepublic was caught in a vicious circle: increasingly bitter political\narguments over the budget helped to put off foreign investors; the\nensuing decline in the availability of short-term credits triggered a new\nround of political wrangling over the government budget.\n\nBy the middle of 1929, the Reichsbank had little alternative but to\nborrow on a short-term basis because long-term American capital was\nno longer available to sustain German budget deficits. However, recent\naccounts of the crisis, notably by Balderston and Schuker, have thrown\nthe spotlight back on the shortcomings of the German response to the\ncrisis. Firstly, they argue that the Republic failed to make the most of\nthe economic boom in 1927 to reduce its budget deficit. Instead, the\nreverse was true as government spending continued to rise well into\n1929. The reflections of S. Parker Gilbert in 1927 proved remarkably\nprescient. As the American Agent-General for Reparation Payments\nput it: overspending and overborrowing on the part of the German\nauthorities would, if unchecked, \u2018lead to severe economic reaction and\ndepression and ... encourage the impression that Germany was not\nacting with due regard to her reparation obligations\u2019.\u2019 Secondly, it was\nnot just Americans who now were loathe to invest long-term in the\nGerman economy. So, too, were the Germans. The monetary history\nof the Weimar Republic and the rapid deterioration of conditions in\n1929 meant the German people themselves quickly became reluctant\nto put their savings into banks and to buy government sponsored bonds.\nThe political context did not help. As 1929 became 1930, it was apparent\nthat the politicians had no easy answers to the growing crisis. Political\ndisputes over the levels of taxation and spending were growing ever\nmore acrimonious. This political failure made the crisis of 1929 to 1930\nall the more severe.\n''"

In the summer of 1929 the hitherto booming economy of the\nUnited States began to exhibit signs of indigestion. It, too, was hard\nhit by falling agricultural prices and, with levels of consumption in\ndecline, industrial production fell by 2.5 per cent. Some sort of\nrecession in America now seemed increasingly likely. In 1929, however,\nsigns that the economies of America and Europe were slowing down\nwere not the most important determinants of American policy.\nUppermost in the minds of American bankers and politicians was the\nspectacular boom taking place in the stock market on Wall Street.\nBetween 1925 and 1929, the value of stocks and shares traded on Wall\nStreet had risen by some 250 per cent. Indeed, by 1929 the stock market\nboom had become such an irresistible attraction to many investors that\nit helped to draw credit away from Europe because the American\neconomy seemed to offer better opportunities to make a profit. It was\nin its efforts to cool the speculative fever in the stock market that the\nUnited States took steps that had profound implications, not just for\nthe American economy, but for the future health of national economies\naround the globe, and therefore the international economy as a whole.\nIn early 1929 the Federal Reserve Board undertook a campaign of\n\u2018moral suasion\u2019 in an attempt to cool the speculative fever of the stock\nmarket. This was followed in August by more dramatic measures. The\nAmerican discount rate was raised from 5 per cent to 6 per cent in a\nconcerted effort to reduce the amount of money circulating in the\nAmerican economy. But the impact of these steps was not contained\nwithin the USA.\n\nIn the 1920s the United States had become the most important source\nof investment for the global economy. Yet its willingness to support the\n\u2018system\u2019 of investment it had helped to create was not tested until 1928.\nIn a time of crisis, the question remained: would the United States\ngive precedence to other countries\u2019 dependence on American dollars\nover the apparent needs of the American economy? Events after 1928\nwere to make clear that the health of the US economy took priority.\nAmerican policy was dictated by considerations of national self-interest.\nAt the time, few were surprised given the priorities of the Federal\nReserve Board and the primacy of national over international\nconsiderations in the reconstructed gold standard.

On a visit to New York in February 1929\nMontagu Norman, reflected the mind-set of bankers everywhere when\nhe urged the Federal Reserve to take \u2018sharp, incisive action\u2019 by raising\nbank rates to break the speculative demand for credit around the stock\nmarket boom in the United States.\n\nThe logic underpinning American policy was at work in Europe too.\nGermany, Hungary, Austria, Poland and other debtor countries, whose\neconomies began to be squeezed as a consequence of the loss of\ninvestment and the contraction of American money, had to look no\nfurther than France for evidence of a similarly tight and self-interested\nmonetary policy. After the successful stabilization of the franc in June\n1928, France failed to play by the \u2018rules of the gold standard game\u2019\nand its monetary policy did nothing to ameliorate the downward\npressure on its neighbours\u2019 economies (p. 62). In theory, the French\ngovernment had the power to do so because of the large amount of\ngold flowing into the vaults of the Banque de France. In the period\nfrom 1928 to 1932, French gold reserves rose from 29 billion francs to\n82 billion francs, yet over the same period, the amount of notes in\ncirculation rose by only 22 billion francs. Recent studies of French\nmonetary policy have demonstrated how the intellectual and\npsychological constraints imposed by the history of inflation on French\nstatesmen, coupled with the legal restrictions on the Banque de France,\nmeant that the rapid accumulation of gold did not lead to a loosening\nof French monetary policy. Inside France, the rising tide of gold only\nconfirmed the wisdom of its commitment to the gold standard.\nMembership of the gold standard had become an article of faith in\nFrench political life, regardless of the negative effects on its neighbours\nof stockpiling gold. At the same time, it is far from clear that an easing\nof French monetary policy would have solved all the problems the\nEuropean economy faced after 1929. It would have contributed little,\nfor example, to solving the crisis of investor confidence in central\nEurope or the declining volume of European trade. A large-scale\nforeign investment programme, sponsored by France and managed by\nthe League of Nations, might have helped, but given the history of\nhuge losses sustained by French investors in Imperial Russia such a\nstep was very unlikely.\n''"

Firstly, it encouraged investment to remain in\nAmerica where it might previously have gone to Europe or elsewhere.\nSecondly, in an effort to attract back the foreign investment on which\nmuch of Europe had become dependent, the central banks of Italy,\nGermany and Britain sought to match bank rates now offered in the\nUnited States. On 26 September 1929, the Bank of England was forced\nto raise its discount rates from 5.5 to 6.5 per cent. In Europe, with the\nimportant exception of France, the step had little effect in luring back\ndollars. What the interest rate hikes did do, however, was to increase\nthe already considerable deflationary pressure on the economy. The\nmonetary vice around Europe was turned ever tighter.\n\nThe response of European governments to the decline of foreign\ninvestment in 1929 underlines the importance of government policy\nto the origins of the Great Depression. Without foreign investment to\noil the operation of the gold standard, the deflationary pressures of\nmembership increased and the shortcomings of the European economy\nwere laid bare. Although the loss of foreign investment did not\nnecessarily mean a great depression would follow, European\ndetermination to stay on the gold standard made it increasingly likely.\nYet governments across Europe were resolved to remain on gold.\nIndeed, the decision to shadow the interest rate increases of the Federal\nReserve Board was also determined by the logic of gold standard\nmembership, and it was this which was to pitch Europe into depression.\n\nIn 1929 and 1930 politicians across the political spectrum in Europe\ncontinued to argue that membership of the gold standard guaranteed\nstability and prosperity not poverty \u2014 a message that was reflected in,\nas well as shaped by, public opinion. Membership of the gold standard\nclub meant that European governments could not take steps to alleviate\nthe impact of the Europe-wide recession and the American contraction\non their economies. Introducing policies to spend money to encourage\nemployment and consumption, like investing in public works, were\nrejected largely for fear of putting additional pressure on the national\nbudget, and thereby jeopardizing the credibility of the exchange rate.\nNor could European banks lower rates of interest to encourage\ndomestic investment and to alleviate the burden of debt on businessmen\nand farmers. Central banks rejected lowering discount rates because\nthis, too, would encourage gold to flow out of national reserves into\nthe bank vaults of France or America where interest rates were higher,\n''"

The collapse in stocks\nand shares was also transmitted to European markets: the Belgian stock\nmarket fell by a full 30 per cent, although the British fall of around 16\nper cent was more typical. Cultural critics, like the Frenchmen Bernard\nFay and Robert de Saint-Jean, now claimed victory over America, the\nnation they earlier denounced as materialist and machine dominated.\nIn Germany, too, those on the right who demanded a return to vdlkisch\n(\u2018pure German\u2019) traditions also appeared to triumph over the advocates\nof Weimar\u2019s \u2018modernizing\u2019 intellectual and artistic movement, the Neue\nSachlichkeit (\u201cNew Objectivity\u2019). But for the many Europeans to whom\nthe 1920s had delivered neither prosperity nor security, it was difficult\nto take much Schadenfreude out of the magnitude of the American crash.\nEuropean confidence in progress had died already in the First World\nWar and an economic situation that many Europeans in the 1920s\nbelieved could not get much worse promptly did.\n\nAgriculture and the Crash\n\nThe most immediate casualties of the crash on Wall Street, apart from\nthe distraught shareholders, were farmers and primary producers. As\nwe have seen, prices for primary products were already falling before\n1929. Thereafter they went into a tailspin, driving farmers ever deeper\ninto debt and despair. The American stock market crash triggered the\nfirst price collapse that hinted at the troubles to come for European\nfarmers and primary producers. Most commodities were shipped to\nthe various ports of the world on consignment. This meant the goods,\nlike wheat, sugar, tobacco, were ordered, but not paid for in advance.\nIn the wake of the Wall Street Crash, confidence collapsed that goods,\nfor example on their way from European farms to the commodity\nmarkets of the United States, would find a buyer. Commodity brokers\nbecame desperate to sell their wares and dramatically dropped their\nprices. The impact on primary prices was immediate and world wide.\nThe price-falls on the American markets were quickly mirrored around\nthe globe because the United States alone accounted for more than\none third of the world\u2019s demand for primary products.

Not only was it difficult for farmers to find any kind of\nmarket for their goods, agricultural exports sold for so little that it was\nwell-nigh impossible for agricultural countries to pay off overseas debts\nor, where needed, to buy in essential industrial products. This was also\nbad news for European manufacturers who now lost important markets.\nBetween 1828 and 1930, Yugoslavia\u2019s drive to make agriculture more\nproductive, for example, benefited from the importation of over 30 000\ntons of machinery, implements and tools. In the six years from 1932 to\n1937, the figure fell to a mere 8000 tons. True, the agricultural\ndepression in the east was made all the more severe because agriculture\nthere had not adjusted fully to the changes triggered by the war. But\nthe \u2018scissors crisis\u2019 wrought by the depression (agricultural prices falling\nsharply in relation to industrial ones), coming as it did after a difficult\ndecade for agrarian countries, was the most challenging problem of\nall. As we have seen, agricultural growth had been unimpressive before\n1929, but the unparalleled fall in prices, together with the bankruptcy\nof thousands of peasant farmers, hindered further development in the\n1930s.\n\nThe response of policy-makers to the crisis only made matters worse.\nRaising prices by relaxing the nation\u2019s monetary policy was out of the\nquestion, thanks to Europe\u2019s continued commitment to the gold\nstandard. The impulse to protect the domestic economy, already a\nfeature of European economic policy in the 1920s, grew much stronger\nafter 1930. The burgeoning regionalism of the 1920s was transformed\ninto the competing trade blocs in the 1930s. In the years between 1923\n''"

The deteriorating economic\nclimate encouraged levels of protection to spiral upwards more quickly,\nand to higher levels, than they had in the 1920s. Of course, in theory a\ntariff is an expansionary policy because it encourages consumers to\nbuy domestically produced goods and dampens down demand for\nforeign produced goods. But the practice after 1930 was much more\nmessy. If the tariff did its job and prices for domestically produced\nbutter and the like begin to rise, then consumers started to complain.\nThe rise in food prices, in turn, triggered demands for higher wages\nfrom the workers and increased costs for their employers. The same\nworkers and employers, engaged in the production of manufactured\ngoods, now found that foreign powers were angry that their agricultural\nproducts faced steep tariffs and retaliated by imposing tariffs on\nmanufactured exports. Manufacturing, already at risk from becoming\nuncompetitive through high wage demands and poor productivity, now\nfound export markets closed off too. (This dynamic can be traced\nclearly in the 1932 and 1933 German-Dutch trade disputes over\nGermany\u2019s butter tariff.) In political terms, protectionism not only ran\nthe risk of setting nation against nation, it also set farmer against\nconsumer and export manufacturers, and marked a considerable threat\nto social peace.\n\nThe liberal trade regime, already under pressure in the 1920s, was\nnow swept away by a new, anarchic international trade regime. As we ~\nshall see in Chapter 5, this undirected process was given a further boost\nby the banking crisis which ravaged much of Europe in the summer of\n1931. After 1929 tariff barriers were raised to new, higher levels. The\nnew political systems established after the war in many European\ncountries continued to make it easy for lobby groups to exert powerful\npressures on governments to protect the domestic market (p. 23). And\nwith legislation already in place in many countries, it was a\ncomparatively quick and easy matter of increasing the level of\nprotection. Relations between European countries quickly deteriorat-\ned in this bitterly competitive environment. Farmers in northern and\nwestern Europe were agitated by the reasonable fear that hard-up\nfarmers in the east would dump their commodities onto western\nEuropean markets given the dramatic fall in commodity prices after\n1929. This was good news for the consumer, but bad news for the local\nproducer, so to protect their own farmers, France, Belgium, the\nNetherlands, and others, introduced new quota systems.

Inside Weimar Germany, where\nthe debate about economic policy was among the most politicized, bitter\nand divided of depression-bound Europe, all the major political parties\ncourted the vote of German farmers by offering protection. Even the\nSocialist Party (SPD) attempted to attract the peasant vote.

By October 1931 food imports into Britain were running\nat 35 per cent above normal levels.\n\nThe huge increase in protectionism across Europe was evidence both\nof the problems faced by primary producers and of their political\nmuscle. Countries that imported food and raw materials, and exported\nmanufactures were in a better position to help domestic producers\nand to bargain with other countries than those who depended solely\non the export of primary products. To the east, only Czechoslovakia\nfell into the category of an industrial power.

At the same time, the new Centrokooperativ\n(central cooperative) dictated a higher price for home-grown produce.\nSimilar initiatives were launched across Europe. While such schemes\ndid help to raise domestic prices, seen from a European-wide\nperspective, they sometimes exacerbated the problem of oversupply.\nFarmers who had not grown wheat now switched to producing it.

But there was also a sinister aspect. Central\nand eastern Europe\u2019s desperation to sell its agricultural products,\ncoupled with greater levels of state intervention in the economy, made\nit easier for Germany to sign mutually beneficial trade agreements in\nthe region. After 1933, these trade agreements also gave Nazi Germany\na political toehold in eastern European countries where it had\nexpansionist designs. Take, for example, the history of German-Polish\ntrade negotiations in the fist half of the 1930s. By 1932 the higher\nlevels of protection around German farmers meant that the German\ngovernment, for the first time since 1925, was able to offer some\nconcessions to Polish farmers wanting to export to Germany, without\nalienating primary producers at home. The Polish-German trade\nagreement signed in March 1932 lowered the tariff on Polish butter\nentering Germany from 170 marks per ton to 100 marks per ton.\n(Although a significant reduction, the protective barrier around\nGerman butter producers was still high.) Hitler subsequently built on\nthis agreement in 1933 with new German-Polish trade negotiations\ndesigned to calm European fears caused by Germany\u2019s withdrawal from\nthe League of Nations and the Geneva Disarmament conference. The\ntrade negotiations also fed into talks, held in 1934, for a non-aggression\npact with Poland. By the late 1930s, as we shall see, the political\ndimension to Germany\u2019s trade policy was more overt now that the Third\nReich had moved from seeking trade agreements to demanding \u2018living\nspace\u2019 for ethnic Germans (p. 174).\n\nFarmers, from Poland to Peru, faced the same challenges. Not only\nwere industrial products now priced beyond their reach, the collapse\nof commodity prices and trade also made it very difficult to pay off\ntheir debts. Farmers had faced these problems in the 1920s, but with\nEuropean food prices falling by an average of 28 per cent in the first\n12 months after October 1929, the problems of indebtedness grew much\nmore severe. At the level of individual farmers, these debts covered,\nfor example, bank loans taken out to buy more land, new equipment\nand chemical fertilizers. Farms in Europe were not repossessed by the\nbanks on anything like the same scale as in America. Instead, the\ngrowing burden of debts was hidden beneath a decline in efforts to\ninvest and modernize farming practices and, in central and eastern\nEurope in particular, beneath mounting poverty and despair. By the\nmid-1930s governments had introduced measures to ease agricultural\nindebtedness by introducing debt moratoria (holidays) of anything up\n''"

The\ncollapse of prices and trade meant that most countries were paying\nout more than they made and the strain on their balance of payments\ngrew acute. Indeed, prices were falling because there was no new\nlending, and there was no new lending because prices kept on falling.\nIf the international economy had been working properly, the decline\nin the ability of poorer countries in Europe to export their products,\nboth agricultural and industrial, should have been matched by\nincreased borrowing by the wealthier nations \u2014 the United States,\nBritain, France, the Netherlands, Switzerland \u2014 to stimulate demand\nand to raise prices. A revival of international lending would have\nenabled increased state spending and industrial development. Instead,\nloans to Europe\u2019s poorer nations dried up at the same time as the\nvolume of their exports fell dramatically. The debtor nations of Europe\nbegan to lose reserves from their central banks as confidence and their\nbalance of payments deteriorated yet further (p. 45). Deeply and\nemotionally committed to gold, these developments at first prompted\nall European governments to redouble their deflationary policies by\nraising interest rates and cutting spending yet further. It was a \u2018triple-\nwhammy\u2019 for the European economy from which France alone, and\nthen only temporarily, was spared.\n\nThe Policy Response: Fighting the \u2018Last War\u2019\n\nBy 1931 most Europeans began to feel as if they were being engulfed\n''"

Commentators\nwrote of \u2018whirlwinds\u2019, \u2018landslides\u2019 and \u2018global shocks\u2019 in a language\nthat suggested that society believed it was caught up in a natural disaster.\nIn reality, the crisis was largely man-made. The sense of helplessness\nthat infected \u2018ordinary\u2019 people and members of the elites alike\nstemmed, in part, from the fact that after 1930 conditions in the\neconomy and society continued to deteriorate when it had been widely\npredicted they would improve. Feelings of frustration were also\ngenerated by the political response to the crisis as governments across\nEurope continued to offer more of the same: gold standard orthodoxy\nand deflation.\n\nOne of the great difficulties in determining the right policy response\nto tackle the onset of the depression was recognizing the crisis for what\nit was. In 1930 it was hard to foresee how deep and protracted the\neconomic collapse was to become. Economic forecasters observed the\nchanges that were taking place around them, but this did not make\nthem alter their expectations about the future. The Harvard Economic\nService, for example, argued in 1930 that the worst of the crisis was\nover. They accepted that a decline in business had taken place, but did\nnot expect it to continue. Typical, too, was the view of a leading Belgian\neconomist, L.-H. Dupriez, who that year claimed: \u2018Nothing in the\ncurrent state of affairs leads us to believe we are threatened with\npermanent unemployment.\u201d In 1930 forecasters understood the crisis\nin terms of the 1920-21 depression that had come in the wake of the\npostwar spending boom. They did not recognize that the deflation\ntaking place in 1930 and 1931 was substantially different to that of the\nearly 1920s. How so? Firstly, the downturn in demand was more\nfundamental and widespread at the beginning of the 1930s than the\n1920s. When the boom ended in 1920, spending soon shifted from\nbuying, or investing in, commodities unavailable or damaged in the\nwar to new products and methods of production. After 1930 demand\nfor all goods, \u2018new and old\u2019, failed to recover and remained severely\ndepressed for the next three years. Secondly, and much more\nfundamental to recovery after 1921, was the expansionary monetary\npolicy pursued in Europe and America. In the early 1920s European\nmonetary policy was very relaxed with governments and banks across\nEurope permitting, indeed, in some cases, downright encouraging\ninflation in order to facilitate economic growth and minimize social\nconflict. And finally, America\u2019s new found status as the world\u2019s leading\ncreditor had also given it an appetite to invest in Europe.\n''"

By 1930 the public demanded\nsolutions, but they, like the politicians and their advisors, understood\nthe causes of the depression through the perspective of past problems.\nPublic and political concern continued to revolve around fears of\ninflation and monetary chaos that had come so quickly in the wake of\nthe 1919-20 boom. It was, as the British economist Ralph Hawtrey later\nput it, like shouting, \u2018Fire, fire in Noah\u2019s flood.\u2019!\u2019 As a consequence of\nthis mindset, the deflationary shock emanating from the United States\ncontinued unchecked into the European economy. American monetary\npolicy eased only slightly in 1930 and the change was not enough to\ntrigger a significant reduction in European discount and interest rates.\nAs Eichengreen, Temin, and others, have made clear, the restrictive\nmonetary policy in the United States greatly exacerbated the depression\nbecause it induced restrictive monetary policies amongst members of\nthe gold standard around the world (p. 43).\n\nSo long as countries were determined to maintain the fixed parity of\ntheir currencies on the gold standard, they could not protect themselves\nfrom the deflationary impulse coming from America. The only way\nEuropean countries themselves could beat deflation and depression was\nto take expansionary measures, like a significant reduction in discount\nand interest rates or a large increase in public spending. But, of course,\ntaking such steps on a scale large enough to produce an upswing in demand\nviolated gold standard orthodoxy. Any country adopting reflationary\nmeasures, or any country that failed to control the mounting pressures\non the national purse, ran the risk of triggering a convertibility crisis that\nwould force their currency out of the gold standard. For European\ncasualties of the 1920s inflation, taking any action that risked gold standard\nmembership was an unthinkable step (in the case of some countries it was\nbarred by international treaty) (p. 58).\n\nThe fact that by 1931 the prices for industrial goods, as well as\nagricultural products, had fallen dramatically was particularly worrying.\nIt was a further indication that the gold standard was not regulating\nthe world economy as it was expected to. As detailed above, in theory\nthe collapse of agricultural prices should have brought some benefit\nto industrial countries. The calculations made by the British\ngovernment offer a good example of the continued widespread belief\nin the self-righting properties the gold standard offered the world\n''"

Falling primary prices meant falling costs,\nwhich translated into falling prices for manufactures \u2014 in theory a\nstimulus to demand. But demand for industrial products did not revive\nin 1930 or 1931. Instead, manufacturers cut back on their purchases\nof raw materials like cotton, iron and steel and coal. Industry and\nagriculture were now two drowning swimmers locked in a deadly\nembrace. Demand in both areas of the economy fell further to become\nthe severest contraction the world has ever known. In the three years\nafter 1929, industrial output fell by one-third, with Poland, Germany,\nAustria, Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia the worst hit countries in\nEurope.\n\nThe continued deterioration of the financial sector made matters\nworse. In 1930 and 1931, central banks across Europe once again raised\ntheir domestic interest rates and restricted the provision of domestic\ncredit to protect the gold parity of their currencies. By this time, gold\nand foreign exchange had begun to flow into America at an alarming\nrate. In Europe, France was the only country to enjoy a similarly strong\nfinancial position. But neither country opted to ease its monetary policy\nto encourage gold to flow out again, thereby violating some of the\nbasic principles of the gold standard and increasing the pressure on\nEuropean countries losing gold (p. 62).

New economic and\nfinancial agencies were set up, and many governments begun to plan\nand to introduce large-scale public work schemes, although Britain\nwas a notable exception.\n\nThe banking crises which swept first central and eastern Europe and\nthen Britain in 1931 form the fulcrum of the Great Depression. In central\nand eastern Europe, commercial banks had strong links to industry and\nthe breakdown of one had serious implications for the other. Particular\nattention will be paid to events in Germany \u2014 the region\u2019s best-studied\ncollapse \u2014 to explore how the failure of commercial banks altered the\nprospects for industrial and agricultural recovery. The banking crisis\nalso put unbearable strain on the Reichsbank and on the German people,\nwho were faced, as in 1922-23, with widespread financial chaos. The\nbanking failures had important consequences within and beyond German\nfrontiers. German recovery policy deserves the disproportionate attention\nit is given because it had implications for economic recovery across\ncentral and eastern Europe, in Scandinavia and for international\ndiplomatic relations (p. 181).

The financial crisis culminated in Britain\u2019s\nabandonment of the gold standard in September 1931, an event which,\nby 1933, had led some 15 other countries to join Britain off gold. The\nflotation of sterling is one of the key turning points in the monetary\nhistory of the twentieth century. It marked the beginning of the end of\nthe gold standard order and pointed the way to genuine recovery. The\nimprovement in Britain\u2019s economic and financial prospects was soon\nnoticeable, although it was not as dramatic as it might have been.

One of the most neglected areas of\nscholarship of the Great Depression is its impact on gender relations.\nWhile a great deal of new work has been done on women\u2019s role in the\ncreation of \u2018maternalist\u2019 orientated welfare states in Europe during\nand after the First World War, the interwar period tends to be treated\nas a whole. There may be good reasons for this, but one consequence\nis that we lack a clear picture of the impact of the depression on the\nlives of women and children in particular. (Kramer\u2019s study of women\nin Frankfurt is a rare example of a detailed examination of women\u2019s\nemployment in the depression.) In some countries new legislation was\nenacted to force women from the workplace. Steps taken in the Weimar\nRepublic to discriminate against so-called \u2018double-earners\u2019, married\nwomen whose husbands were expected to bring in a \u2018family wage\u2019, is a\ngood example. At the same time, there are also cases where employers\npreferred to sack the males and keep their female workers because\nthey were cheaper. The sacrifices made by women to keep the family\ngoing during times of extreme hardship have been the subject of greater\nstudy. In homes where the main, usually male, breadwinner was\nunemployed, women \u2014 mothers, daughters, grandmothers, aunts \u2014\nwaged a full-time battle against poverty. Their skills at penny-pinching\ncould make considerable difference to the family\u2019s prospects for\nsurvival. Informal and irregular sources of income from cleaning, taking\nin laundry and child minding became vital to the family economy.\n\nUndoubtedly, the depression took a heavy toll on children and the\nmen too: infant mortality began to rise; unemployed men suffered\nphysically and psychologically. Young men were especially hard-hit by\nthe social and psychological effects of unemployment.

Indeed, some\npoliticians and economists fell into this trap at the time. However, the\nneed for brevity prevents further discussion of the wealth of materials\nhistorians have uncovered which convey the subjective experience of\nwhat it was like to be unemployed in the Great Depression.\n\nThere was not much help to be had from state-led efforts to help the\njobless. Although many states in Europe had welfare systems \u2014 some\nmore rudimentary than others \u2014 the very scale of the problem, coupled\nwith budget orthodoxy, soon exhausted the welfare budget. As so often,\nthe Weimar Republic provides the most clear-cut example. In August\n1930 some 453 000 workers were dependent on welfare support\n(around 15-17 per cent of the total registered as unemployed); one\nyear later there were | 131 000 (26.8 per cent) and by August 1932 the\nfigure had risen to 2 030 000 (38.9 per cent). Private charities and small\nrelief schemes tried to step in to fill the breach left by the state\u2019s failing\nprogrammes, however, their efforts were often but a drop in the bucket\nof need.\n\nIn 1930 and 1931, as we have seen, the majority of established\ndemocratic political parties in Europe offered no alternative to trade\nprotectionism, which had a mixed effect on employment, and belt-\ntightening determined by gold-standard orthodoxy. The financial\nconservatism of politicians and financiers was heightened by the\ndeterioration of the political climate triggered by the economic\ncollapse. It is important not to oversimplify the relationship between\neconomic misery and political radicalism. Many countries around the\nworld experienced intense economic hardship, but did not succumb\nto political extremism; the example of the United States, which endured\nthe most acutely depressed economy in the western world, is the most\nnotable. However, in much of central and eastern Europe, the coming\nof the depression seemed to validate all the criticisms made of the\ndemocratic system by those on the right and the extreme left of the\npolitical system. (Right-wing parties proved more successful at seizing\npower.) Most insidious was the idea that an effective policy response to\nthe depression could only be found through a change of political\nregime to produce an authoritarian reform of the constitution, or even\na dictatorship. Pilsudski\u2019s manoeuvrings in Poland are as illustrative of\nthe phenomenon as the collapse of democratic politics in the Weimar\nRepublic.\n\nThere was plenty of finger-pointing at the international level too.\nThe American President, Herbert Hoover, wrongly presented the\n''"

Many European governments,\non the other hand, claimed the destabilizing impulse had come from\nAmerica to Europe. The European critics were closer to the truth. The\ncontraction of the American economy had such dramatic effects\nbecause it was so large and because governments across Europe chose\nto tighten the hold of orthodox economic policies to maintain their\nmembership of the gold standard. The deflationary impulse emanating\nfrom the United States was transmitted to Europe through the\n\u2018mechanics\u2019 of the gold standard. The problem could have been tackled\nmost effectively by international cooperation: a coordinated\ndevaluation of currencies on gold, coupled with the introduction of\nreflationary measures. But one of the defining features of the\ndepression after 1929 was the rapid disintegration of international\ncooperation, such as it was, on all issues but reparation payments. The\ndepression was a global crisis. No one was left untouched by its impact,\nyet nationalism dominated the political and popular response to the\ncrash. Looking back on the 1930s, it is all too easy to categorize the\nexperience of people and their political representatives, regardless of\ncountry, as broadly the same. It did not seem that way at the time. The\nseverity, duration and timing of the crisis varied considerably and these\ndisparities, coupled with the primacy of domestic political and\neconomic concerns, greatly complicated the context of international\nrelations; the problem is typified by the trade protectionism that swept\nEurope (p. 137). History also played a role. It was not easy for\ngovernments and their advisors to conceive of international cooperation\noutside the framework of the gold standard. The gold standard gave a\nfocus to all efforts at cooperation in the 1920s and the experience of\nthe past continued to shape expectations of the future. If cooperation\nfailed within the gold standard, then nationalism appeared to be the\nsole alternative.\n\nOpting to fight the economic depression while remaining on gold\nmeant that governments, determined to balance their national budgets,\nfound themselves growing increasingly short of \u2018cash\u2019. Government\nspending was rising while tax yields were falling \u2014 thanks, in large\nmeasure, to the declining numbers of employees, investors and\nbusinessmen who were in a position to pay taxes.

The Soviet Union then went ona\nshopping spree, buying up German machinery that was going cheap\nthanks to the depression, to meet the remaining requirements for\nindustrial imports of the Five Year plans.\n\nIn European politics, some of the bitterest political disputes were\nfought not between party-political opponents, but within the political\nparty of the ruling government or coalition. The trend was especially\nmarked in governments dominated by socialist or labour political\nparties where there was a dramatic divergence between electoral\npromises to generate employment and greater social equality, and the\northodoxy underpinning economic policy. It was a problematic position\ngiven that the government would spend vast amounts on social\nprogrammes to provide relief for the unemployed, but would spend\ncomparatively little on schemes to generate employment. (A good\nexample of this tension is found in Britain in the summer of 1931.)\nIndeed, as the economic and financial climate deteriorated in 1930\nand 1931, those who advocated expansionary policies or implementing\nmeasures to improve living standards sometimes became isolated and\ndefensive.\n\nThe question as to how far incumbent governments enjoyed the\nfreedom to make economic policy as they would have wished demands\na complex answer.

None the less, the budget cuts had a strongly\ndetrimental effect on the German economy because it was in such a\nweakened condition already. They served only to depress further prices\nand employment opportunities in Germany with the attendant social\nand political costs \u2014 notably the electoral success of the NSDAP and\nKPD.\n\nNevertheless, Bruning increased the deflationary pressure on the\nWeimar Republic when the opposite was needed. There is still a lively\ndebate amongst economic historians regarding Borchardt\u2019s once\ncontroversial contention that the Republic had lost whatever \u2018room to\nmanoeuvre\u2019 it had to make economic policy with the onset of the\ndepression \u2014 in other words, Bruning had few policy options available\nto him by the time he had taken office. Most historians agree that\nChancellor Briining did not tighten the deflationary screw around the\nGerman economy because he lacked the imagination to do anything\nelse. Important contributions to the debate have been made recently\nby James and Balderston who demonstrate that, even before the\ndepression struck, the Reich was able to carry only a very small debt.\nAs we have seen, the German capital market had failed to recover from\ninflation, with German investors struggling to build up their savings in\nbanks after 1923, making it difficult for business and government to\nborrow money. The government was also desperately scratching about\nfor money to pay for the most basic of services because restrictions\nimposed on the Reichsbank prevented it from printing money\n(monetizing its debt) to help out the government. It was the threat of\nstate bankruptcy, and not the fear of inflation per se, that limited\nBrtining\u2019s room for manoeuvre.\n\nEconomists continue to explore whether there were any genuine\nalternatives to the disastrous course taken by Germany. They are rightly\nasking important questions about how governments should handle\nmajor economic crises that may be of value to policy-makers in the\nfuture. But for historians trying to understand why Germany\u2019s\ndepression was one of the most acute in Europe and why Weimar failed,\nthe significance of what actually happened is measured against what\nthe evidence shows might have happened or almost happened. The\nquestion is not what Chancellor Briining should have done, but what\nhe could have done to improve the economy. At the time, a number of\nGerman economists did advance proposals for public works schemes\nto stimulate economic recovery (p. 141). A possible devaluation of the\nReichsmark was also discussed.

In 1931 the\ndeteriorating prospects for industry combined with renewed anxiety\nabout the solvency of many banks joined together to whip up a storm\nin European banking. A further irony of the banking crisis was that it\nmade bankers one of the most unpopular groups of people in Europe,\nand seemed to pitch the interests of industry and agriculture against\nbanking in much the same way as the increasingly nationalist response\nto the crisis appeared to set the interests of one nation against another.\nBut it is important to step back from the climate of recrimination that\ncharacterized the interest-group politics of the time. An understanding\nof the processes under way in the banking crisis underlines how far\nthe interests of farmers, businessmen, workers and bankers were all\nbound up together.\n\nBanking structures across Europe varied considerably, both at the\nlevel of commercial and central banks. Local features played an\nimportant role in determining the effectiveness of the banking\nstructures in supporting industry and agriculture, and in withstanding\nthe crisis of 1931. Banks in central and eastern Europe were especially\nvulnerable to collapse for two main reasons. Firstly, these countries\nhad become highly dependent on foreign capital. This had almost dried\nup completely by 1931 so public and private sectors were both chasing\nthe dwindling supply of domestic capital. Banks were caught in the\nmiddle. They could only lend more money to government by reducing\nthe volume of loans extended to private corporations and businesses.\nSecondly, commercial banks in central and eastern Europe had\nparticularly close links with industry. The well-being of one directly\naffected the health of the other. The interdependency of their\nrelationship, typical of the great \u2018universal\u2019 banks of the region, is\ncrucial to understanding the mechanics of the banking crisis which\nenveloped central Europe in the summer of 1931: with interest rates\nstill rising thanks to gold standard orthodoxy, it became prohibitively\nexpensive for many industries to borrow money. As a result, companies\nwere forced to reduce stocks of their goods by dropping their prices.\nAs prices fell, so, too, did the value of securities given by the companies\nto commercial banks to secure their loans; as the value in the securities\nfell, so the banks demanded additional securities to cover loans; if these\nwere not forthcoming, then the next step was for the banks to call in\nthe loans.

The process could have been stopped\nby vigorous intervention by the central bank to help the commercial\nbanks and by an easing of the deflationary pressure applied by\ngovernments and central banks: both measures ruled out by gold\nstandard orthodoxy. In 1931 the results of this process were disastrous\nfor banking, industry and agriculture alike.\n\nThe banking collapse began in earnest in Austria in May 1931. In\nretrospect, neither the location nor the timing of the crisis was\nsurprising. Although mergers to salvage ailing banks had become\ncommonplace in 1920s Europe, Austria had experienced more than\nmost. The disintegration of the Austro-Hungarian empire, rampant\ninflation, agricultural depression and, after 1929, industrial collapse\nhad all taken their toll. So, too, had the intimate relationship between\nindustry and banking. Austrian industry was exceptionally dependent\non bank loans, while the banks, in turn, owned very high levels of stocks\nin their client companies. The relationship was too close to be healthy.\nTo sustain their own creditworthiness, the banks had to keep industry\nafloat, and worked hard to cover-up industrial losses and to create an\nillusion of prosperity. Neither party gained in the long run. When\nindustry failed, so did the banks; when the banks failed, so did industry.\nBanking mergers offered a temporary respite, but the result of each\nmerger and consolidation was that the surviving banks had an even\ngreater number of potentially insolvent companies dependent upon\nthem. It was no accident that the Creditanstalt, Austria\u2019s largest bank,\nwhich crashed spectacularly in May 1931, itself had merged with the\nnation\u2019s second largest bank, the Bodencreditanstalt, in 1929.\n\nWith the onset of depression and the evaporation of foreign credit,\nit became increasingly difficult for Austrian banks to maintain the\nfacade of solvency. The reality was revealed on 8 May when auditors\ninformed the Austrian Finance Minister that the bank had incurred\nrecent losses amounting to some 140 million schillings. In the weeks\nthat followed, no bank in Austria, including the House of Rothschild,\ncould offer sufficient support to bail out the Creditanstalt.

Foreign creditors, too, did their\nbest to ease the financial crisis. Their most important contribution was\ntheir agreement to a set of standstill agreements that froze their loans\ninside Austria.\n\nThe run on the banks also triggered a loss of confidence in the\nAustrian schilling. In the five months following the announcement of\nthe Creditanstalt\u2019s difficulties, the Austrian National Bank lost around\n700 million schillings in foreign exchange. On 9 October 1931, the\ngovernment finally acted. Rather than abandon gold, the central bank\nintroduced exchange controls to direct the amount and destination of\ngold and foreign currency leaving Austria. These became an elaborate\nnetwork of bilateral payment agreements. Organized on a country-by-\ncountry basis, earnings were collected and payments deducted, usually\nthrough clearing accounts set up in pairs of central banks. It was a\nhighly complicated system and made the machinery of international\ntrade very cumbersome indeed.

Neither the\ninterventions of the Bank of International Settlements in Geneva, nor\na cooperative bank credit organized by the leading European and\nAmerican central banks was sufficient to halt the banking collapse.\n\nThe collapse of the Creditanstalt also had implications for Hungary\nbecause the bank was the major source of capital for the Hungarian\nbanking system. The pattern of events here was much the same as in\nAustria. International assistance failed and Hungary\u2019s government was\nforced to come to the aid of its largest bank, the General Credit Bank,\nby lending it some 40 million peng\u00e9s. By the middle of July, as in Austria,\nthe Hungarian banking crisis had resulted in greater state intervention\nin the economy and exchange controls designed to limit the outflow\nof gold and foreign currency from Hungary. These steps restricted the\nimpact of the gold standard on Hungary\u2019s economy. Bulgaria,\nYugoslavia and Czechoslovakia all experienced comparable problems\nand reached for similar nationalist solutions. By the latter half of 1931,\nthey had all introduced exchange controls. So, too, had Romania in\nMay 1932. Only Poland was able to remain free of exchange controls,\nand then only until 1936.\n\nItaly, too, experienced a commercial banking crisis in 1931, but\nneither the Italian people nor foreign governments were aware of it.\nItaly\u2019s three largest banks, the Credito Italiano, the Banca Commerciale\nand the Banco di Roma (with close links to the Vatican), all experienced\ndifficulties \u2014 the latter was bailed out with a secret government-\nsponsored loan of one million lira. The fascist government and the\nBank of Italy both worked hard to keep these worrying financial\ndevelopments secret.

The strategy was a success and helped to forestall\nthe widespread panic which helped to undermine banking structures\nelsewhere.

In 1933 the League of Nations\nestimated that Spanish industrial production had fallen by only 15.6\nper cent below its peak in 1929. Harrison, however, has shown this\ninsulation was not complete. Spain was hit hard by the collapse of\ninternational trade (the slowdown in the French economy after 1931\nwas especially damaging) and by the reduction of emigrant remittances\nto dependants back home. By December 1933, 12.8 per cent of Spain\u2019s\ninsured population were out of work, with the southern agricultural\nregions of Andalusia and Extremadura worst affected.

Of course, the collapse of the Austrian banking system was a\nworrying backdrop to developments in Germany. So, too, was news\nthat some German banks might be in trouble because loans extended\nto Austria were now frozen under the Austrian standstill agreements.\nBut it was the deteriorating condition of German banks and their\nrelationship with public and private debtors, on the one hand, and the\nReichsbank, on the other, which made the German banking crisis so\nsevere. The drama began on | July when news broke of the expensive\ngamble taken by the giant German textile concern, Nordwolle. Early\nin 1931 it had bought over a year\u2019s supply of wool in anticipation of\nhigher prices, with money borrowed from the Darmstadter und\nNationalbank (DANAT Bank). But prices had continued to fall, and\nthey took Nordwolle and the DANAT Bank with them. The dam now\nburst and the dynamic which had undermined Austria\u2019s banking system\nand its currency now swept through Germany (p. 120). The withdrawal\nof credit from the biggest commercial banks in Germany quickly\nbecame a flood. In June alone, the DANAT Bank lost over 40 per cent\nof its deposits (RM 847.8 million), the Dresdner lost 10.7 per cent\n(RM 218.1 million) and the Deutsche Bank 8.2 per cent (RM 321.5\nmillion). In an effort to hang on to their reserves, the banks put up\ntheir interest rates and cut back on loans to business. Many of the poor\ninvestment decisions made in the 1920s were now coming home to\nroost (p. 38). Companies across Germany were now under pressure to\nrepay their loans quickly \u2014 even firms that normally would be seen as\nhealthy had their credit withdrawn and faced the prospect of\nbankruptcy.\n\nThe role of the Reichsbank now became crucial. Statutory\nresponsibilities and good sense determined that the Reichsbank should\nact to help out Germany\u2019s commercial banks. But as soon as the\nReichsbank began to use its gold and foreign currency reserves to\ndiscount bills from the commercial banks, people began to question\nthe Reichsbank\u2019s commitment to defending the Reichsmark \u2014\nspeculative pressure on the mark soon followed.

The reserves of the Reichsbank were not large enough.\n\nWith its gold reserves dwindling rapidly, the Reichsbank soon reached\nthe legal limit of 40 per cent gold cover imposed in 1923. New loans\nfrom Britain and the United States in June 1931 were too small to\nhelp, and by 1 July the Reichsbank could not replenish the shrinking\nreserves of German commercial banks because no more foreign loans\nwere forthcoming. The Reichsbank was working very hard to defend\nthe parity of the mark, but now had to stand idly by and watch as the\ncrisis in the domestic banking system continued. The alternative for\nthe Reichsbank was to put all its efforts into stabilizing the domestic\nfinancial system at the expense of Germany\u2019s membership of the gold\nstandard. But to allow the value of German mark to fall was an\nunthinkable step at home and abroad.\n\nThe spectacle of financial pandemonium greatly unnerved the\nGerman people as German banks, as they had in 1923, once again began\nto close their doors on their customers.

Throughout the banking crisis, political debate inside\nGermany, coupled with the diplomatic efforts of the British\ngovernment outside, stressed that Germany could no longer afford\nto pay its reparation bill. Seen from within the cauldron of German\npolitics, Briining\u2019s strategy makes perfect sense: reparation payments\nwere the one aspect of his chancellorship where he stood a chance of\nbroad political and public support. Indeed, when, on 21 June the\nAmericans announced the Hoover Moratorium, a 12-month\npostponement of all payments of reparations and war debts, the\nChancellor\u2019s strategy appeared to have paid off. But the Hoover\nMoratorium did nothing to still the German banking crisis. Debt\npayments were undoubtedly a burden on the German budget, but\nthey were not fuelling the run on Germany\u2019s banks. The moratorium\u2019s\nfailure only underlined that the dynamic behind the banking crisis\nwas taking place within the German economy. Nor did the Moratorium\ndo much to help countries who owed war debts to the United States.\nIn fact, during the depression war debts were as much a political as\nan economic problem. Although America\u2019s position on \u2018hired money\u2019\nremained the same, a series of international negotiations in the 1920s\nhad considerably reduced French, Belgian, Italian and, to a lesser\nextent, British debts as well. By 1930 the United States had, for\nexample, waived 35 per cent of Italy\u2019s debt, 65 per cent of French\nand Belgian debts, and 35.1 per cent of British debts. The allied debts\ndid not constitute a great burden on the balance of payments of these\ndebtors, but the debts were a cost to the exchequer that had to be\nincluded in national budgets, although some governments, notably\nBritain, stopped including them in 1932.

This is because,\nalthough the German banking crisis did not end until August,\ninternational attention had long since switched from Germany to\nBritain where a new banking crisis was under way. The sterling crisis,\nwhich ran from July to September 1931, became one of the turning\npoints in the monetary history of the twentieth century and marked\nthe beginning of the end of the gold standard system. In Britain it was\nnot the commercial and savings banks that were under pressure, but\nthe central bank, the Bank of England. From 13 July onwards, the gold\npound was sold heavily on the international exchanges and the Bank\nof England had to work hard to defend sterling\u2019s parity with gold and\ncurrency reserves. Once again, \u2018foreigners\u2019 were blamed for selling\nthe pound in favour of gold, with the British press singling out the\n\u2018greedy, irresponsible French bankers\u2019 for particular criticism. The\nAmericans, too, were condemned for their unwillingness to extend\nnew loans to the Bank of England. Now that the richest members of\nthe \u2018gold club\u2019 were under pressure (they were also the leading\ndemocratic powers), they began to fall out with one another. It was a\nworrying omen for the prospects of future international cooperation.\nIronically, if any single overseas power was responsible for the pressure\non sterling, it was Germany, for the timing of the crisis was precipitated\nby revelations of the volume of British loans frozen inside Germany \u2014\nsome \u00a362 million \u2014 under the standstill agreements.

By 1931 Britain had a chronic\nbalance of payments crisis: invisible earnings from the financial services,\nshipping and overseas business profits had all collapsed; so, too, had\nBritish exports. (Although the prices for imported commodities on\nwhich Britain was heavily dependent had fallen dramatically since 1929,\nit was not enough to offset these problems.) The final blow to the gold\npound came in August 1931 when the minority Labour government\nwas unable to resolve the growing crisis over the budget. For much of\nthe 1920s the British economy had been one of the most depressed in\nwestern Europe \u2014 since October 1929 it appeared to have fared better\nthan many other countries, in part because it did not have so far to\nfall. Ramsay MacDonald\u2019s Labour government, like the equally ill-fated\nGrand Coalition led by the SPD in Germany, had come to power shortly\nbefore the onset of the Great Depression with a pledge to tackle Britain\u2019s\npersistent unemployment problem. The issue had dominated\ncampaigning for the 1929 election, but the minority Labour\ngovernment found itself quickly overtaken by events. Labour\u2019s\nministers, like their luckless socialist counterparts across Europe, had\nno new weapons to combat the slump. Jimmy Thomas, Britain\u2019s Minister\nfor \u2018Unemployment\u2019, had plenty of ideas to expand existing national\nrelief schemes, but the usual budgetary constraints stood in the way.\nEurope\u2019s socialist parties continued to demonstrate they were much\nbetter at devising palliative schemes to provide financial and social\nassistance for the unemployed than they were at creating policies to\nimprove the performance of the economy.\n\nQuite how much the Labour government was constrained by the\ngrowing budget deficit was revealed by the findings of the May\nCommittee on 31 July. Published on the final day of the parliamentary\nsession, the report pointed to the serious problems in British industry\nand finance. It was estimated that by April 1932 the British government\nwould be \u00a3120 million in the red. The Committee urged the British\ngovernment to increase taxes and introduce economies, largely by\ncutting unemployment benefit. It was the latter demand which split\nthe Labour movement: on the one side was the TUC and cabinet\nmembers like Arthur Henderson, who believed any reduction of\nbenefits was a betrayal of party principles in general and the working\nclass in particular; on the other, a group, including MacDonald and\nthe Chancellor of the Exchequer, Philip Snowden, who asserted that\nreducing expenditure was the only way to preserve the stability of the\nBritish economy.

By 17 September international\ncooperation among the world\u2019s most powerful central banks in Britain,\nParis and New York had failed to stave off the collapse of the pound,\nand on 20 September Britain was \u2018forced off\u2019 the gold standard. The\nend of the gold pound, however, was not so much a defeat as a\nsurrender. It is clear that by the summer of 1931, many in parliament,\nthe Treasury, and even some officials within the Bank of England, had\nlost faith in the benefits to Britain of gold standard membership (at\nleast until the system was reformed). In effect, the British government\nand the Bank of England had given up trying to preserve sterling\u2019s\nfixed parity of $4.86. Where recent history had taught countries like\nFrance, Germany and Hungary the horror of inflation and the sanctity\nof gold parity, Britain\u2019s less than illustrious economic history since\nreturning to gold had taught the opposite: the gold standard was a\nrecipe for economic and social misery. It meant that, unlike in much\nof continental Europe, the political costs of allowing sterling to float\non the international exchange were not very high.\n\nWhat of the economic risks? For Britain there were only benefits, as\nwe shall see. The costs were borne by those powers which remained\ncommitted to the gold standard, notably France, Belgium, the\nNetherlands and the United States. Interest and discount rates were\nlowered as the British government embarked on a policy of \u2018cheap\nmoney\u2019 to encourage demand and investment.* The British government\ncontinued to claim it had been \u2018forced off\u2019 the gold standard, but in\ntime it became apparent Britain had no intention of returning to the\nsystem. Over the next six months, partly by accident and partly by\ndesign, the British government developed a national and regional\nstrategy for economic recovery. Interest rates were reduced and the\npound was allowed to depreciate by around 30 per cent relative to\ncountries which had retained their fixed parity with gold, most notably\nFrance and the United States (the bank rate fell from 6 per cent in\nSeptember 1931 to 2 per cent in June 1932 and stayed there until the\noutbreak of war). The Bank of England also lost some of its\nindependence in determining monetary policy, although it was put in\ncharge of the new Exchange Equalization Account (EEA) set up to\nsmooth out fluctuations in sterling\u2019s exchange rate. Currency\ndepreciation underlined a trend that had been under way since 1929:\n''"

As Senator\nBorah, Chairman of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations,\nfulminated in a radio broadcast, the EEA was \u2018being used to depreciate\nthe pound and appreciate the dollar, thereby giving Britain an\nadvantage in world markets against the United States\u2019 .\u2019 It is true Britain\nsoon cherished the benefits of deprecation as both trade and\nemployment began to revive. Britain\u2019s role as a leading exporter and\nimporter of goods (coupled with the fact that many of its import\nmarkets, such as New Zealand and Denmark, followed sterling off gold,\nensuring a continued fall in import prices) meant currency\ndepreciation had a particularly beneficial effect on the British economy.\nBy 1934 production was higher than it had been in 1929. A housing\nboom, fed by reduced interest rates now sterling had left gold, saw\nthree million dwellings built \u2014 the fastest ever rate of construction\nexperienced to that date. Unemployment, too, fell from a peak of three\nmillion in 1933 to just over two million in 1938 (structural problems\nand the loss of export markets help to explain this lacklustre aspect of\nBritish recovery.) At the same time, the British government was also\nanxious that European countries committed to gold should remain\nthere. It feared widespread currency chaos, with all the attendant\ndanger it would bring to the already precarious condition of political\nlife in central Europe.\n\nBritain\u2019s abandonment of gold had wide-ranging international\nimplications. Depreciation was an indirect form of protectionism for\nthe British market \u2014 imports from nations still on gold were now more\nexpensive \u2014 and legitimated the drive for protectionism by governments\ncommitted to gold. In the longer term, sterling\u2019s depreciation worked\nto increase the deflationary pressure faced by European countries still\nin the system and to undermine the credibility of the gold standard as\na whole. Moreover, currencies that were once undervalued on gold,\nlike the Belgian and French francs, became overvalued as the\ndepression wore on. In the short term, too, dramatic consequences\nwere readily apparent. Countries with large reserves of sterling in their\nbank vaults found it was worth considerably less after 20 September\n1931 and that it could no longer be converted freely into gold. France,\nfor example, was enraged that sterling reserves held in the Banque de\nFrance, totalling almost $62 million, or 8 billion francs, were now\n''"

Although French losses amounted to less than 2\nper cent of the assets held by the Banque, it undoubtedly soured Anglo-\nFrench relations. The French government demanded compensation\nand promptly slapped a 15 per cent surtax on British goods entering\nFrance. Shortly afterwards, the French also began to sell their sterling\nholdings in favour of gold \u2014 a development which put increasing\npressure on American gold reserves and Franco-American diplomacy.\n\nOther countries holding sterling in their currency reserves were\nsimilarly affected, but their frustrations emerged in earnest at the World\nEconomic Conference in June 1933. At present, there is no comparative\nrecord of these losses or of losses generated by subsequent devaluations.\nIn the early 1970s historians and economists, led by Friedman and\nSchwartz, studied the role played by these foreign currency reserves to\nexplain the speed and magnitude of the 1931 banking crises. More\nrecent interest, however, has focused on the role played by foreign\ncurrency reserves and sterling\u2019s depreciation in the emergence of new\ncurrency blocs \u2014 the sterling bloc, the gold bloc and so on. These blocs\nfrequently developed associated trading agreements, designed to give\npreference to trade with other members of the group over non-member\ncountries. The blocs had important consequences both for economic\nrecovery and diplomatic relations in the 1930s.\n\nThe \u2018sterling bloc\u2019, as it was called in the 1930s, was the first\nrecognisable currency group to emerge in the international economy.\n(During the Second World War it shrank in size, became more focused\nin character and became known as the \u2018sterling area\u2019.) With the value\nof sterling depreciating, countries whose central banks held large\nreserves of sterling and/or were highly dependent upon trade links\nwith the United Kingdom, also opted to depreciate their currencies.\nMembers of this informal group used sterling, instead of gold, as the\nmonetary standard on which the international values of the various\ncurrencies were based. Unlike countries that adopted exchange\ncontrols, members of the sterling area could freely buy any currency\nor gold, but, of course, it was easier and more profitable to do business\nin sterling with other members of the group. The empire and the\ncommonwealth were at the heart of this bloc. When Britain left gold it\ntook with it empire currencies already pegged to sterling, namely India,\nCeylon and Burma. Australia and New Zealand joined too. (Canada\nhad already left gold in the winter of 1928/29 for domestic reasons.)\nSome European currencies also chose to peg their own currencies to\nthe pound, including Norway, Sweden, Denmark and Portugal, with\n''"

Instead, it served to increase the resort\nto \u2018beggar-thy-neighbour\u2019 policies by countries still committed to gold.\nThe latter were all too aware that the sterling bloc was a protectionist\narrangement because the pound\u2019s depreciation in value made exports\nmore competitive and imports into the sterling area from countries\nwith fixed exchange rates much more expensive. As we have seen,\nFrance slapped a 15 per cent surtax on British goods entering France\nin the wake of sterling\u2019s flotation. In the summer of 1931 new and\ntougher quotas were also introduced by Belgium, Switzerland, the\nNetherlands, Czechoslovakia and France \u2014 all future members of the\ngold bloc. When it came to introducing quotas, the French government\nwas widely considered to be the worst offender: by the end of the year,\nthe French quota system covered over 1000 products; by 1934 it spanned\n3000 different items. After 1931 quotas became commonplace in\nEuropean trade. As in the 1920s, farmers\u2019 organizations played an\nimportant political role in securing protectionist measures, although\nincreasingly such organizations were eclipsed, or fell under the\ninfluence of right-wing political groups with more extreme and\nambitious agendas.

In 1931 German plans for trade treaties with\nRomania and Hungary were scuppered by the objections of the United\nStates and others under their MFN rights. By the end of 1932, however,\na way around the problem had been found: plans were in place to\nbreak off treaties with France, Sweden, the Netherlands and Yugoslavia\nthat had served as anchors for Germany\u2019s MEN treaties. Within months,\nGermany was free of these obligations and had also concluded\npreferential agreements with the Scandinavian dairy producers\n(Denmark and Finland). By 1933 the stage was set to enable the new\nNazi government to establish a vigorous new course for German trade\npolicy. In central and eastern Europe bilateralism and regionalism had\nfirmly replaced multilateralism and MFN as the watchwords of trade\nrelations. A similar trend was evident in northwestern Europe. In\nFebruary 1933 Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg signed the\nOuchy Convention to guarantee one another exclusive tariff reductions.\nAlthough the plan was stalled for a year, by 1934 the Ouchy countries\nwere joined by other members of the gold bloc \u2014 France and Switzerland\n\u2014 in the Brussels Protocol, which sought to expand their mutual trade\nand to discriminate against countries who had depreciated their\ncurrencies and deployed tariffs against them (like Britain).\n\nBritain\u2019s transition to protectionism was arguably the most\nremarkable of all. Here, party politics, economics and a vision of\nhistorical destiny came together to shape Britain\u2019s break with the Free\nTrade ethos which had dominated its trade policy since 1846. The step\nhad serious international ramifications because Britain continued to\nbe the world\u2019s most important import market, taking in, for example,\n63 per cent of all Danish exports, 21.4 per cent of Dutch produce, and\n17.8 per cent and 10 per cent of French and German production\nrespectively. Until 1931 over 80 per cent of imports entering Britain\ndid so duty-free. Following the depreciation of sterling, a number of\nso-called \u2018emergency\u2019 measures to protect the British market were\nrushed through parliament by the National Government. As with\nBritain\u2019s departure from gold, at first, trade protection was presented\nas a short-term tactic taken to deal with the depression crisis. By\nNovember 1932, however, steps were under way to make British\nprotectionism permanent. During the next six months the National\nGovernment, dominated by members of the Conservative party, moved\nto extend the Abnormal Importation Act to a full General Tariff. It\nraised duties on a long line of finished goods to 20 per cent, with levies\nof up to 33.3 per cent on products of what were considered to be key\n''"

As Garside\u2019s recent summary of the debate demonstrates, the\nbudgetary crisis and deterioration in Britain\u2019s balance of trade also\nplayed a crucial role in persuading politicians and the public to move\nto protection. By 1931 it was accepted across the political spectrum\nthat tariffs would generate much needed revenue for the government\nand reduce the volume of foreign imports entering Britain. Most\nbusinessmen, financiers and politicians believed the revenue generated\nby tariffs to be essential to forestall further budgetary crises and to\nkeep the floating pound stable. The same rationale underpinned the\nmove to protection in European countries still committed to gold. Some\nLiberals continued to provide a dissenting voice. They (rightly) argued\nthat sterling\u2019s flotation negated the need for tariffs because\ndepreciation had already increased import prices and cheapened\nexports. Indeed, protection actually threatened the benefits of the\ndevalued pound to British export trade because countries might\nretaliate with new protectionist measures of their own.\n\nHistory gave the protectionist debate in Britain a distinct dimension.\nSince the nineteenth century, calls to protect the British market had\nlong been linked with demands for closer economic integration within\nthe Empire and Commonwealth. In June and July 1932 these demands\nadded the third and final layer of trade protectionism with agreements\nsigned at the Imperial Economic Conference convened in Ottawa. The\nImperial preference agreements reduced the tariffs levied on imperial\nprimary producers by around 10 per cent, and thereby provided them\nwith privileged access to the British market. The Ottawa agreements\nalso enabled the National Government to appease working-class\nconcerns that tariffs would increase food prices. Imperial preference,\nthe public was told, meant cheaper food. Needless to say, these tariff\narrangements reinforced the regional dimension to Britain\u2019s recovery\nstrategy created by the sterling bloc, and enabled imperial debtors to\nearn sufficient sterling to pay off debts owed to British banks. It was\nthe principal reason the City of London was in favour of protection.\n''"

Governments had responded to mounting political\npressure by acting to protect domestic production and, whenever\npossible, to maintain welfare payments. These steps were gradually\nreinforced by more interventionist government policies. Of course, in\nlarge parts of central and eastern Europe, governments had little choice\nbut to become more involved in running the economy because of the\nproblems experienced by banks, industry and agriculture during the\nbanking collapse. But many European governments were specifically\nelected to take a more \u2018hands on\u2019 approach to the economy, motivated\nby the scale and persistence of the unemployment problem and the\nattendant social unrest, and informed by new ideas.\n\nThe Briton John Maynard Keynes is the economist credited with\ncontributing the most to debates regarding the role of government\npolicy in managing the economy. Although his ideas did not reach\ntheoretical maturity, and a broader public, until the publication of his\nGeneral Theory of Employment, Interest and Money in 1936, he was active as\na member of the Economic Advisory Council set up by MacDonald in\n1930, and an effective publicist for his ideas among elites, at home and\nabroad, long before then. While his policy proposals did not take hold\nin Britain until the Second World War, thanks to his high international\nprofile and contacts overseas, his ideas informed and, in turn, were\nshaped by those of leading German economists, notably Wladimir\nWoytinsky, and the Swedes Bertil Ohlin, Gunnar Myrdal and E. R.\nLindahl. Motivated by intellectual discovery and humanitarian concern\nfor the unemployed, these economists challenged the established\northodoxy by demanding that government increase its spending by\nsetting up programmes of large-scale public works to reduce\nunemployment and to stimulate demand, generating benefits that\nwould grow and ripple (\u2018multiply\u2019) out across the entire economy.\n\nDiscussion of the need for public work programmes became\ncommonplace in Germany in 1932 and, unlike Britain, had exponents\nwithin the Economics Ministry like Ginter Gereke and Wilhelm\nLautenbach. By April 1932, encouraged in part by the findings of a\ncommission set up by Briining to study the problem of employment and\nthe lobbying of ministers, the German government agreed to spend a\nmodest 135 million Reichsmark on work creation.

The benefits to the German economy, in the case of the Papen\nPlan and Schleicher\u2019s \u2018Sofortprogramme\u2019 (initiated by Weimar\u2019s final\nChancellor, Kurt von Schleicher), came too late to profit Weimar\u2019s last\nChancellors. However, Hitler quickly adopted public works into his\npolitical programme as a versatile means to generate recovery and later\nrearmament (p. 175).\n\nIt was Sweden, the most industrialized economy in Scandinavia, that\nappeared to adopt the most coherent approach. In 1932 a coalition\ngovernment, dominated by the Social Democratic Party, took up the\nideas of Ohlin and Myrdal in a series of initiatives that were presented\nas a radical break with the past. Finance Minister Ernst Wigforss took\nan innovative approach to the government budget (balancing it over a\nnumber of years rather than annually) to increase revenue available to\nthe government. This money was then ploughed back into the economy\nin subsidized building schemes and public works programmes. The\ngovernment also attempted to set wages for those employed on the\nschemes at market rates, rather than at the level of the lowest paid, in\norder to increase further the volume of demand in the Swedish\neconomy. Contemporary estimates suggest that around 40 000 jobs were\ncreated between 1934 and 1935. To support agriculture, the\ngovernment introduced new subsidies programmes, dubbed \u2018cow-\nswaps\u2019 by the general public. These measures undoubtedly played an\nimportant part in preventing even worse levels of unemployment and\npoverty. The Swedish \u2018experiment\u2019 was closely watched by many\neconomists, including Americans who went on to shape Roosevelt\u2019s\nNew Deal, but then, as now, its results remain controversial. Gustaffson\nhas argued recently that in the Scandinavian context, the ideas\nunderpinning the famous Swedish model were neither new nor\nparticularly radical. There is evidence that public works and deficit\nfinancing had been employed already in Sweden before 1914 to combat\nunemployment, while in the 1930s state intervention in the Danish\neconomy was not only much greater, but also more successful than in\nSweden. (Comparatively little is known about Norway.)\n\nEven in \u2018innovative\u2019 Sweden, the pressure for financial probity\nremained strong. As in Germany in 1932, the amounts spent by the\nSwedish government were not large \u2014 little more than one per cent of\nGNP from 1932 to 1934. Moreover, it now seems clear that Swedish\nrecovery was strongly influenced by the benefits of a stable banking\n''"

The role of Germany in Sweden\u2019s recovery grew\nparticularly pronounced as German rearmament accelerated (p. 181).\n\nBritain was the one major economic power that did not introduce\nlarge-scale public works in the 1930s. The apparent success of Italian\npublic works certainly stirred the Labour leader Ramsay MacDonald\u2019s\nadmiration: \u2018Italy today is violating the principles of the economically\nsound but her object is to increase national energy ... we must definitely\nbring national spirit into the catalogue of economic factors.\u2019!* But it\nwas the Liberal Party which offered the British electorate the most\ninnovative policies. Economists have estimated that if the Liberal Party\u2019s\nproposals, based on Keynesian ideas, for public works had been\nimplemented some 300 000 unemployed Britons would have found\nwork. But the traditional \u2018economic factors\u2019 were not easily sidestepped.\nKeynes\u2019s proposals were pooh-poohed as crackpot by the Treasury, in\nparticular, where the determination to maintain a balanced budget\nremained very strong. It was also argued that government investment\nwould discourage (\u2018crowd-out\u2019) investment from the private sector, and\nmany economists would now accept that, in economic terms, the effect\nof the \u2018multiplier\u2019 is not as strong as once thought. Political and\npsychological reasons also underpinned the \u2018Treasury view\u2019: if the\ngovernment appeared extravagant, it might lose the support of business,\ncurrency stability would be threatened and the benefits of \u2018cheap\nmoney\u2019 lost. It was a view that gained credence following events in\nFrance after 1936 (p. 186). The prevailing culture of the political\neconomy was, and is, not easily overturned. Until rearmament began\nin earnest in 1938, British deficits remained small.\n\nEven the famed Italian public works schemes, initiated before the\nonset of the depression, were not an unqualified success.

It marked the beginning of the end of the gold standard\nsystem. Freed from the budgetary constraints imposed by membership\nof the system, countries like Britain could have spent more public\nmoney than they did to offset the collapse in private spending and\ninvestment. But as we have seen, there were limits \u2014 real and perceived\n\u2014 about how far they could go, particularly when the national currency\nremained open to a collapse in confidence. (Countries with exchange\ncontrols were protected from this to a degree, but had different\nproblems (p. 171)). The benefits of currency depreciation became\nmore apparent with the flotation of the dollar in 1933. This is because\nin 1931 and 1932 the climate of international uncertainty continued\nto make countries, including those off the gold standard like Britain,\nanxious to hoard gold. In the immediate wake of sterling\u2019s flotation,\nthe Bank of England began to rebuild its lost gold reserves, increasing\nthe deflationary pressure of countries remaining in the system. The\nBritish were also very reluctant to let gold flow out as their economy\nrevived. Given that British policy was supposed to have undergone a\nrevolution, it was surprising to note how much it still had in common\nwith countries that remained on gold. In 1932 France and the United\nStates, the two countries who had enormous reserves of gold and could\neasily have afforded to take more fundamental expansionary measures\nthan Britain\u2019s, for the time being remained psychologically and\npolitically unprepared for such \u2018radical economics\u2019.\n\nWage rates may also have acted as a drag on recovery. During the\ndepression, many politicians repeated arguments made in the 1920s\nthat wage rates were too high.

In the Far East came Japan\u2019s\ndramatic incursion into Manchuria; the invasion\u2019s heady mix of\nimperialist aggression and economic nationalism was a worrying pointer\nto the future.

It came as the established channels of European\nand American international economic relations \u2014 trade negotiations\nand monetary cooperation through the gold standard \u2014 grew\nincreasingly clogged with disputes over protectionism and, after\nSeptember 1931, currency depreciation. Hoover\u2019s initiative did not\nmark the dawn of US leadership to goad other powers into new ways of\nthinking and dealing with the crisis. It did, however, have an important\nimpact on shaping European expectations of US policy with regard to\nwar debts and reparations.

The failure of international cooperation\nby the end of 1933 convinced Europe of the wisdom of nationally\norientated recovery measures.\n\nA large number of authors have emphasized the failure of the United\nStates to provide the leadership vital to light the way out of the crisis.\nRegardless of whether others would follow, the United States was the\nonly country in the 1930s with sufficient monetary power to make a\nbig difference to the condition of the international economy.

Moreover, when it came to more political\nquestions, like those embedded in trade protectionism or war debts\nand reparations, leading the way was only the first step in a complicated\ndance. The ability of other countries to demonstrate a genuine political\nwill to cooperate was equally important. The rapid turnover in\nEuropean governments since 1929, itself a consequence of the\ndepression, introduced lots of new partners, some of whom were\nviolently hostile to international cooperation, into the diplomatic mix.\nFrom the vantage point of the Cold War, it was all too easy for scholars\nto underestimate how difficult it was to achieve international agreement\non an economic or monetary issue, even when countries shared similar\nliberal democratic values and capitalist economies. Leadership was not\njust about economic power, but also about diplomatic experience,\npolitical will, historical precedence and a perception of who was strong\nand who was weak in the context of the depression. The seesawing\nfortunes of the world\u2019s leading diplomatic actors further confused the\npicture.

The proposal resurfaced, championed by the British\ngovernment, in the wake of the Hoover Moratorium in the summer of\n1931. The development was not accidental. Domestic and international\nconcerns combined with the legacy of history to trigger a short-lived\nBritish determination to, in Prime Minister MacDonald\u2019s words, take a\n\u2018big, bold lead in the world\u2019.! The primary focus of British, and sub-\nsequently, conference diplomacy in 1931 and 1932 were reparation\nand war-debt payments. Britain\u2019s initiative, in part, grew out of the\nmisleading signal to Europe in the Hoover Moratorium that the White\nHouse finally recognized the interconnection between reparations and\nwar debts. This development, coupled with Republican urgings that\nthe banking collapse was \u2018patently a European crisis\u2019 at meetings like\nthat between French Premier Pierre Laval and President Hoover in\nOctober 1931, laid a trail that was to lead European policy on debts\ninto direct confrontation with the interests of the United States in the\nsummers of 1932, 1933 and, most dramatically, 1934.\n\nAlthough British economic and monetary policy took on a strong\nregional perspective after 1931, the pragmatism which was a defining\ncharacteristic of British policy determined that an initiative in Europe\nto resolve the reparations and war-debts zmbroglio would bring important\neconomic and diplomatic benefits within, and beyond, European\nfrontiers. The standstill agreements negotiated between Britain and\nits creditors in Europe were a significant force behind the development\nof policy too. These determined that the health of the British banking\nsystem was increasingly equated with the stability of German finance\n(p. 130).

A new government, a reassessment of Franco-\nGerman relations, and the determination to bring the French public\non the side of reparation revision all contributed to the shift in French\npolicy. (It is not yet fully appreciated how far French interests in eastern\nEurope also shaped its changing policy on the question of reparations.)\nAs so often in the depression, however, changes in policy to tackle the\ncrisis failed to keep pace with political developments. On 30 May\nBruning resigned, to be replaced as German Chancellor by Franz von\nPapen who extended the Chancellor\u2019s extra-parliamentary powers yet\nfurther. Equally worrying, given the massive crisis of confidence that\ngripped Europe, was the fact that Papen\u2019s ultra-conservative cabinet,\nin common with its right-wing successors, now explicitly tied German\ndemands for equality in armaments with a call for \u2018equality of economic\nrights\u2019. It did not augur well for the disarmament conference due to\nopen in Geneva that autumn, nor for the return of confidence in\nEurope\u2019s economy any time soon.\n\nThe deal negotiated at the Lausanne Conference in July 1932 enabled\nGermany to secure the benefits of Anglo-French diplomacy without\nany further responsibilities on the question of political debts. The final\nreparations settlement came on 7 July 1932 when, after a relaxed dinner\ntogether, Herriot and Chamberlain negotiated late into the night,\nsketching out the final settlement on Chamberlain\u2019s napkin. The issue\nof war guilt was resolved to the satisfaction of France, and Germany\nwas to make one final, lump sum payment of 3 billion Reichsmarks (it\nnever did) before the reparations slate was wiped clean. But before\nBritain could justly claim it had put an end to 13 unlucky years of\ninternational disputes over reparations and war debt payments, one\nsizeable obstacle remained: war debts due to the United States. In order\nto secure French agreement to the reparations settlement, Britain and\nFrance concluded a secret \u2018Gentleman\u2019s Agreement\u2019 that postponed\nratification of the Lausanne deal until a \u2018satisfactory settlement\u2019 had\nbeen reached between Britain, France, Italy, Belgium (a further co-\nsignatory) and \u2018their own creditors\u2019. Should they fail, then in theory\nthe arrangement with Germany would not be ratified, and the Young\nplan would be reinstated. In practice in the coming years, however,\nthe problem of war debts became a running sore in European relations\nwith the United States and, to a lesser extent, a source of tension\n''"

Within days news of the\n\u2018Gentleman\u2019s Agreement\u2019 leaked out and the deal was greeted with\nhowls of dismay on the other side of the Atlantic.

From the outset,\nand despite America\u2019s refusal to allow the issue onto the conference\nagenda, war debts were the primary focus of British, and to a lesser\nextent French, economic foreign policy. Unsurprisingly, the thrust of\nAnglo-French policy was to persuade the United States to accept a\nfinancial settlement similar to that made in July 1932 by scaling down\nwar debts commensurate with the final lump sum owed by Germany.\nBritain marshalled strong economic arguments as to why payments\nshould cease, most notably that the collapse of primary prices and\ninternational trade, coupled with the depreciation of sterling, had\nenormously increased the real value of the debts to be paid: the sum\npaid by Britain in 1923 represented the value of six months\u2019 worth of\nexports, whereas the payment due in 1932 equalled the value of four\nyears\u2019 exports to the United States. As we shall see in Chapter Seven,\nthe worst of the French depression was still to come.\n\nGiven the relative health and wealth of the French economy, Herriot\u2019s\ngovernment took a different tack. It emphasized the political benefits\nto be had by freeing Europe from the burden of its political debts and\nthe diplomatic value of the new concord in Franco-German economic\nand monetary relations; the latter reinforced by French overtures to\nthe Weimar government to make joint policy preparations for the World\nEconomic Conference. (The initiative died a rapid death with the\nadvent of the National Socialist government in January 1933. The\nItalians made similar proposals to the NSDAP that were also turned\ndown.) In the United States both the outgoing Republican admin-\nistration and the incoming Democratic regime were unmoved by the\nAnglo-French case. They were unimpressed by the economic argument,\nespecially given the apparent health of the French economy. Here,\nonce again, the operation of the gold standard obscured reality. The\nAmericans focused solely on the fact that France had \u2018withdrawn\nenough gold from the Federal Reserve to pay its entire war-debt\nobligation\u2019 until 1942, and ignored evidence of the French economy's\ngrowing malaise more generally. Moreover, the political case was\ninsufficient to sell the cancellation of debts to the American people,\nmany of whom were struggling to meet debt payments \u2014 on their homes,\ntheir land, their cars \u2014 of their own.

None were forthcoming.\n\nInstead, by December 1932 both Britain and France were threatening\nto default on their loans to the United States. At the eleventh hour\nBritain stepped back from the brink and made the payment due in\nfull, frightened of the implications of default for its status as the world\u2019s\nmost respected financial power (it feared the move would encourage\ndebtors to default on loans owed to Britain).

A further, bitter irony was\nthat while Britain, France, Belgium, Italy, Czechoslovakia, Estonia,\nHungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania and Yugoslavia were now\nbranded defaulters by the United States, countries which owed large\namounts in commercial loans, like Germany, were not.\n\nIn 1933 and 1934 the showdown Britain had sought on political debts\ndid not unfold as planned.

The American government\nexplicitly decided to leave for the sake of the domestic economy. By\nJuly 1933 domestic and foreign commentators were under no doubts\nthat recovery was well under way. Within four months, the dollar had\ndepreciated by around 40 per cent of its former value on gold and the\nUS economy began to show signs of recovery. Taking the year 1929 as\n100, factory employment had risen from 56.6 per cent in March 1933\nto 70.1 per cent by July 1933, prices had risen from 59.8 per cent in\nFebruary 1933 to 99 per cent by July of the same year, and department-\nstore sales had risen from 57 per cent to 71 per cent \u2014 that these\nindicators had some way to go before reaching their 1929 levels also\ndemonstrates that complete recovery was still some way off.\u00ae\n\nOf course, given what we now know about the stranglehold gold\nstandard membership had on the ability of countries to recover from\nthe gold standard, Roosevelt\u2019s action begs important questions\nregarding America\u2019s failure to lead the rest of the world to recovery by\neffecting a coordinated devaluation or depreciation with countries still\nin the system. The dollar\u2019s flotation has been described by historians\nof the New Deal as the President\u2019s first nationalist act. Yet it could have\nbeen an internationalist act of ttemendous import. There are, hidden\namong the documents of the period, memoranda that reflect what\nmight have been. First, in late November 1932, came a proposal from\nHerbert Feis, international economic advisor to the State Department,\nfor an American-led coordinated devaluation of all currencies within\nthe gold standard system. His comment at the time, that the proposal\nbelonged \u2018to the world of H. G. Wells\u2019, demonstrated quite how far\nthe idea seemed beyond the pale.\u2019 Then, in April and May 1933, came\nwidespread rumours in both the British Treasury and the Foreign Office\n\u2014so far it has not been possible to trace their provenance \u2014 that Britain\nand other members of the sterling bloc were to join Roosevelt\u2019s new\ncurrency bloc of currencies off gold. And finally, there was a proposal\nfrom one of FDR\u2019s advisors, on the eve of the World Economic\nConference, for the President to issue such a strongly worded attack\non the gold standard as to push France and other members of the gold\nbloc out of the system. It was a call for America to take the lead and to\nforce the world to be free of gold standard orthodoxy.\n\nThe failure of governments, of both western Europe and the United\nStates, to take up these calls for a coordinated attempt to reflate the\nworld economy lays bare may of the shortcomings of international\n''"

Firstly, it underlines the continued\nconservatism of monetary and economic policy, even when countries\nhad abandoned gold. Neither Britain nor the United States, for\nexample, went as far as they might have in efforts to reflate the domestic\neconomy. To its credit, the British government considered the question\nof encouraging other countries off gold in the wake of sterling\u2019s\ndepreciation in a more systematic way than America. But it was\nunprepared to promote a coordinated devaluation alone, or in tandem\nwith the USA, and feared uncoordinated currency flotation would bring\nonly uncertainty and chaos. There would also be a price to pay at home.\nAs the Treasury put it: \u201cBritish competitive power would be greatly\ndiminished if Austria and Czechoslovakia, for example, devalue their\ncurrencies. HMG would be severely criticized by traders if devaluation\ntook place as result of pressure by us.\u2019!\u201d Roosevelt\u2019s action had won\nwarm praise in some quarters in Britain. The left-leaning Daily Herald\nnewspaper, for instance, claimed \u201cMr Roosevelt had the courage Mr\nMacDonald lacked. The government, the Treasury and the Bank of\nEngland remained obstinately timid\u2019 in their monetary policy.'\u2019 But\nsuch views were not commonplace in Europe in 1933.\n\nEven if America or Britain had attempted to give a lead on monetary\npolicy, it was not necessarily enough to effect international\ncollaboration in the fragmented world of the 1930s. Acting alone they\nhad neither the political will nor the power to \u2018force\u2019 European nations\nto cooperate. As far as FDR was concerned, the European countries\nalso had to demonstrate a political will to work with the United States.\nIndeed, America\u2019s ability to work with Europe was likely to have been\nreinforced by a clear European demonstration of a desire to cooperate\nwith Washington. Instead, events in 1933 and 1934 appeared to confirm\nUS suspicions that the major European powers were not interested in\ncoordinating monetary or economic policy with the United States. So-\ncalled \u2018Anglo-Saxon\u2019 cooperation might have led the way, but the\ninternationalists in Roosevelt\u2019s administration were discouraged and\nweakened by the direction of domestic economic policy and by Britain\u2019s\ndetermination to protect its national and imperial interests in\npreference to making friendly overtures to the United States.\n\nThe World Economic Conference Convenes, June-July 1933\n\nOn the 12 June 1933 delegates from 65 different countries and six\n''"

The economic questions for\ndebate centred on the need to improve conditions of production and\ntrade, with particular attention to the issues of tariff policy, prohibitions,\nrestrictions and quotas, and producers\u2019 agreements. (In spite of\nAmerican opposition, the British exploited their position as host to\ninclude a veiled reference to the problem of war debts.)

The idea\nfor a stabilization agreement to cover the life-time of the conference\nhad emerged first in October 1932, as a means to quell currency\nfluctuations between floating currencies and those on gold. Once\nagreed, the pact was intended to enable conference participants to get\non with negotiating issues such as trade discrimination and\ninternational public works, free from the distraction of currency\nfluctuations.

By January 1933,\nthree months before he was fully installed as Secretary of State, Hull\nused the Republican sponsored tariff truce for the World Economic\nConference in efforts to secure the first reciprocal tariff agreement\n(RTA) with the British government. The State and Commerce\nDepartments even harboured hopes that an Anglo-American RTA would\nprovide the basis for initiating multilateral tariff reductions throughout\nthe world through the operation of unconditional most-favoured-nation\ntreatment. American hopes were supported by the conviction that\nBritish power was founded on free trade and that Britain would, with\nAmerican support, return to free trade. As one American official put\nit, \u2018the idea for a bilateral trade treaty with the British\u2019 arose because:\n\u2018they would probably be the easiest person [sic] to do it with ... and\nthen see what kind of animal that would be and how wide its application\nwould be to others.\u2019!\u00ae\n\nThe historian\u2019s privilege of hindsight makes the first two years of\nRoosevelt\u2019s presidency seem like a lost opportunity in Anglo-American\neconomic relations. Back in 1933 the timing of Secretary Hull\u2019s tariff\noverture appeared particularly poor \u2014 Britain\u2019s Abnormal, General and\nImperial tariffs had only just passed into law, and it remained unclear\nhow far Hull enjoyed the support of a president apparently torn\nbetween the nationalist and internationalist elements in his\nadministration. Equally unconvincing from the British perspective was\nthe way that the State Department skirted over the sticky question of\nwhether Congressional support for the RTA could be secured. On a\nmore fundamental level, however, the problem was one of competition.\nBritain\u2019s \u00a370 million trading deficit to the United States was a genuine\nobstacle to the conclusion of an Anglo-American trading agreement,\nas well as a source of great embarrassment; so, too, was British\ndetermination to strengthen its imperial power base and to meet\npromises to protect the national economy made to the electorate (p.\n194):\n\nIn the same way that Roosevelt was not prepared to make any kind\nof monetary commitment that threatened his ambition to reflate the\n''"

Secondly,\nwhile it is true that the American administration might have tried\nharder to demonstrate a clear lead by generating coordinated plans\nfor currency depreciation, perhaps in tandem with the British\ngovernment, there is little evidence to suggest members of the sterling\nor gold blocs would have supported it.

In a feeble attempt to make up for the lack of\nfinancial help, the British, German and US governments were in rare\nagreement that the countries of the Danubian region be encouraged\nto sign multilateral trading agreements with each other and to \u2018learn\nto speak with one voice\u2019 on economic issues.** The events in London\nleft the \u2018lesser\u2019 powers of central and eastern Europe only more\nvulnerable to economic penetration by predators like Germany.\n\nFor most of the decade, policy-makers in London, Washington and\nParis recognized their fundamental divergence on economic issues.\nMany of these differences originated in the national responses to the\ndepression first taken in 1931 and 1932, and yet, for the most part, the\nsources of economic discord largely remained unresolved for the rest\nof the decade. Until 1936 the French commitment to the gold franc,\nAmerica\u2019s determination to reflate its domestic economy, and Britain\u2019s\ndedication to war-debt revision with its economic independence intact,\ncondemned efforts at economic diplomacy among the democracies to\nfailure. This, perhaps, was only to be expected given that the move to\neconomic nationalism was precipitated by the tremendous social and\npolitical pressures generated by the depression. However, the failure\nof, in particular, Britain and the United States and, to a lesser extent,\nFrance to employ energetically the lessons of their failed cooperative\nefforts between 1931 and 1934 generated sizeable obstacles to be\novercome in the future. The war debts saga had ended with much of\nEurope branded in default to the United States; France led a band of\nhardy gold bloc members who were determined to cling to the gold\nstandard; and Roosevelt, though the protagonist of last-ditch attempts\nto find an economic path off the road to war, offered only tariff\nagreements and limited cooperation on monetary issues, and remained\nresistant to any further economic commitment to the European\ndemocracies at the expense of American domestic public opinion. The\nfailure of international diplomacy in 1933 reinforced and justified the\nrecourse to nationalism that had dominated European economic and\npolitical life since 1931.\n''"

Secondly, the deterioration in\nprospects for trade was reinforced by the persistently depressed state\nof international lending. The movement of capital and investment in\nthe international economy no longer lubricated the links between\nnational economies to the good of the international system as a whole\nas it had in the 1920s. Instead, the most stable and apparently secure\ncountries became sanctuaries for foreign capital. In the seven years\nfrom 1931, Britain absorbed some $4 billion, while the United States\ntook in almost $5.5 billion between 1934 and 1937 (and ever larger\namounts as war in Europe loomed), with Switzerland, the Netherlands\nand Scandinavia importing smaller amounts. Feinstein and Watson have\nnot been able to determine quite where all the money was coming\nfrom, although gold bloc members France, the Netherlands and\nBelgium were undoubtedly important losers in this process as their\ncontinued membership of the gold standard came under pressure after\n1931 (p. 186). With exchange controls and trade barriers continuing\nto rise, it is small wonder that investors remained cautious and preferred\nto squirrel their monies away in Britain and the United States (and\nother neutral, stable territories) rather than bearing the risk of putting\nit into countries, such as those in central and eastern Europe, where\nforeign investment was urgently required to effect recovery. There were\na few exceptions, notably Romania, which secured foreign capital to\ndevelop its oil industries.\n\nThe international political context forms the third important\ndeterminant on the prospects for domestic recovery. The growing\ntension in international relations \u2014 with a major diplomatic incident\nerupting almost every year until the outbreak of war in 1939 \u2014 acted to\ndepress confidence. Moreover, the proclaimed autarky of the nationalist\naggressors in Europe, first Germany and then Italy, also sapped the\npolitical will of other countries to do anything about the spiralling\nlevels of protectionism. Even some of the more positive political\nconsequences of the depression, like the election of Franklin Roosevelt\nand the recovery of the US economy, had some negative consequences\nfor international diplomacy. Financiers and bankers were in bad odour\n(export industries were also weakened), thereby silencing groups which\nhad lobbied for American involvement in the wider world in the 1920s.\n\nThe fifth feature of the world economy in the 1930s was much more\npositive: the trends evident in the 1920s \u2014 of innovation, rationalization\n''"

The production of motor vehicles, household\nappliances and new types of fabric all contributed to recovery and to\nan improved sense of well-being in Europe. (Bernstein also argues that\nin America\u2019s case, it is the failure of these consumer industries to forge\nahead as they did later in the 1950s which explains why US recovery\nfaltered by 1937.) Important advances also continued in the production\nof chemicals, while electricity became the principal source of light and\nheat; there were also new methods of communication, notably radio.\nBut, as before, the processes of modernization and rationalization were\nimplemented unevenly in the European economy.

Not only was the 2.5 per\ncent rise one of the highest in Europe, it was also higher than levels\nachieved by Britain in the 1920s (and close to the level achieved in the\n1950s).\n\nTable 7.2 Cost of Living Index\n\n \n\n \n\n1929=100\n\nCzecho France Germany Poland Spain UK\n19305198 101 96 a2 103 96\n#931 94 OF 88 83 107 90\n1932 92 88 78 75 103 88\n1933 of 85 77 67 100 85\n19345790 82 PS 63 102 86\n1935 93 75 80 60 99 87\n1956\u2018 794 80 81 58 90\n\n \n\nSource: 1.

(Data on this has not yet been as\ncomprehensively collated or assessed as for the 1920s.) The problem,\nalongside that of wage rates, is best examined on a national basis, but\nit is also worth bearing in mind that, throughout the 1930s, those in\nwork found themselves relatively well-off. Prices continued to remain\ncomparatively low when set against wages, so the hard-earned pound,\nfranc or pengo went further at the shops. It is difficult to generalize\nabout the reasons behind this. Historians have found it difficult to\nexplain the relationship between the price level and wage level for\neven a single country: in France union power might have helped to\nkeep wages high; in Britain lower prices may simply have been thanks\nto the coincidence of its high levels of imports and falling import prices\nIn the interests of recovery, it would have been better if wages had\nfallen into line with price levels. Only Germany succeeded in pushing\ndown wages. To flesh out why this was so, and to understand other\nforces underpinning Europe\u2019s shaky recovery from depression, we must\nturn to the national perspective.\n\nThe National Socialist Recovery\n\nUnsurprisingly, once again, developments in Germany are among the\nbest studied of the period. By 1936, with unemployment at 1.6 million\n(falling to 0.9 million in 1937) and industrial production rising for\nthe first time above levels achieved in 1928, Germany appeared to have\nscored a genuine and sustained recovery. The history of recovery under\nNational Socialism, however, begins where that of the Weimar Republic\nended: with the impact of international capital on the German\neconomy. After 1933 Germany experienced an outflow of over $1\nbillion. Of course, a proportion of these monies reflected the\ndesperation of the victims of National Socialism to place their assets, if\nnot themselves, abroad, and have been the focus of recent legal actions\nagainst Swiss and British banks. But Nazi Germany was also uniquely\ndetermined among members of the \u2018pseudo gold bloc\u2019 to reduce levels\nof its overseas debt in order to maximize its freedom to spend precious\ncurrency and gold reserves as it wished. (As we saw in the case of\nHungary, when Britain and the United States floated their currencies,\nall countries still on gold found their sterling and dollar debts reduced\nautomatically.)

At least,\nthis way, payments due on French exports and loans to Germany were\nlikely to be met, in the words of one French official, \u2018in contrast to the\nold experiences of promises being broken and minced words\u2019.2 The\nprice of this greater state control was a lower level of German foreign\ntrade when compared to the 1920s: in 1928 German exports were worth\n12.3 billion Reichsmarks; during the 1930s, they never exceeded 5.6\nbillion Reichsmarks. By the mid\u20141930s, however, German trade had\nbegun to recover some lost ground, especially in relation to other major\neconomies. Overy calculates that by 1938 over 50 per cent of German\ntrade was covered by bilateral agreement and these agreements also\nhelped Germany to control its trade deficit. From 1935 to 1937, it even\nenjoyed a positive balance of trade.\n\nIn German foreign trade relations, countries which imported high\nlevels of German goods were politically useful, and those which\ncontinued to lend money to the Reich were favoured over those who\ndid not. The contrasting treatment administered to Britain and the\nUnited States, first seen in 1933, was illustrative of the trend and became\nconspicuous after the conclusion of an Anglo-German Clearing\nAgreement in July 1934 and the subsequent introduction of the New\nPlan. As we have seen, the standstill agreements of 1931 linked the\nhealth of banks in the City of London (and their pre-eminence in\nfinancing German trade) to that of the German economy and this,\ncoupled with a balance of trade in Germany\u2019s favour, ensured a\ncooperative Anglo-German understanding on debts and trade. Germany\npaid fairly promptly for its imports from Britain (the Nazis were\nespecially anxious to import rubber, tin and copper from the British\nEmpire) and, more importantly, made the required repayments on its\nstandstill agreements. This, in turn, secured continued British demand\nfor German machinery and equipment and, more importantly, a\ncontinued supply of credit from Britain. Indeed, Britain became the\npre-eminent source of credit to Germany. According to figures offered\nby Newton, in October 1931 around 28 per cent of all standstill credits\nwere British, by September 1937 the figure stood at 52 per cent and\npeaked in 1939 at 56 per cent; it was only then that the Bank of England\n''"

After 1933, the much trumpeted search for Lebensraum\nin the east motivated trade deals with Balkan countries, but these\nbrought only limited economic gain for Germany, with exports to the\nregion rising from only 6.9 per cent in 1935 to 11 per cent in 1938.\nChallenging earlier accounts of German penetration to the east, Kaiser\nhas demonstrated how some countries in central and eastern Europe\nresisted the National Socialist ambition to draw them into a semi-\ncolonial relationship because they were intent on industrialization and\nmodernization. (Similar tensions surfaced in British imperial\neconomics.) Bulgaria became the most dependent, taking all its imports\nfrom Germany and exporting over two-thirds of its produce to the\nReich. Hungary, too, was drawn into an ever-closer trading relationship\nwith Germany (p. 180). When strategy demanded it, however, Germany\nmade considerable economic sacrifices for political gain. The most\ndramatic example was the Nazi-Soviet trade deal signed in August 1939.\n''"

Indeed, during the first\nyears of the Third Reich, officials in the US State and Treasury\nDepartments and the White House all argued that German economic\nrecovery was so fragile it was unlikely the Nazis would remain in office\nfor long. Most historians agree that the revival of investment, much of\nit from the state, was central to the German recovery. Between 1933\nand 1934 the level of public investment doubled as government funds\nwent straight into employment schemes, industrial investment and\nconstruction plans. Government expenditure increased by a further\n60 per cent during 1935. These figures were impressive when related\nto levels of direct state expenditure in the Weimar economy of the\n1920s. Overy estimates that by 1938 state spending accounted for 33\nper cent of GNP compared to 17 per cent of GNP spent in 1932. Levels\nof private investment grew much more slowly. Mefo bills have received\na great deal of attention by scholars as the tool used by the German\ngovernment to generate investment in heavy industry and to conceal\nrearmament. The bills, issued by the newly created Metallurgische\nForschungsgesellschaft (Mefo), were used by government contractors\nto pay for what they needed. Mefo bills were then cashed in at the\nReichsbank (or held by other banks or private investors) until the\ngovernment was ready to repay them out of the increased revenue from\ntaxation as the German economy grew. In effect, Mefo bills were used\nas an alternative currency and between the years 1934 and 1938 they\nachieved a circulation of around 12 billion Reichsmarks. The practice\nbreached existing financial legislation in Germany and enabled the\nNazis to circumvent a financial system which had been badly damaged\nby events in 1931 and 1932. At the same time, many of the tools used\nby the Reich to generate investment were also conventional, such as\nhigher taxes, and designed in part to maintain the facade of orthodox\nmonetary and fiscal policy, and to conceal rearmament. The Reich took\nconsiderable trouble to maintain an appearance of budgetary\northodoxy as befitted a nation that still claimed to be a member of the\ngold bloc.\n\nWhat made the difference to Germany\u2019s recovery effort was the\ncumulative effect of National Socialist led investment and spending in\nthe economy, although some Nazi programmes were more effective\nthan others.

Small business, for example, benefited\nfrom government measure to ensure they received contracts to supply\nthe new construction projects.\n\nSpending policies also became a lever to extend National Socialist\ncontrol over society. This is most clearly demonstrated in Nazi policies\ntowards the working class. Temin emphasizes how personal freedom\nand autonomy were sacrificed to the government\u2019s determination to\ncontrol wages and production by destroying labour unions (they were\nreplaced by workers\u2019 courts) and making a government agent\nresponsible for wage bargaining. They also introduced compulsory\nlabour service in 1935. As a result, wages were kept low and failed to\nkeep pace with rising national income, falling from 64 per cent to 57\nper cent of national income between 1932 and 1938 \u2014 a policy that\nhelped to earn Nazi economics the epithet \u2018capitalism with a cudgel\u2019.*\nHere, Germany is the exception, for in every other European country\nin the 1930s for which calculations have been made, wage rates were\nhigher than prices. Italy and France, two struggling members of the\ngold bloc by the mid-1930s, both tried and failed to introduce wage\ncuts.

Nor were all German workers hostile to the\nregime, divided as they were by age, gender, occupation and \u2018race\u2019.\nThe point is illustrated clearly by the much vaunted scheme for\nmarriage loans introduced in 1933. Newlyweds could apply to the Reich\nfor a loan of up to 1000 Reichsmarks, in certificates, to buy furniture\nand household goods for the home. The loans were interest free and\nthe sum owed was reduced for each child born to each new family (the\nloans, in effect, were transformed into family allowance). The\ncertificates generated the desired demand for German small business,\nand proved very popular with over 183 000 loans taken up by the end\nof 1933. But there was also a sinister side. The loans were conditional\non the woman giving up paid employment, a new attack on so-called\n\u2018double-earners\u2019, and were refused if one or both of the marriage\n''"

Schacht\u2019s answer, supported by certain\nsections of German industry, was an \u2018export drive\u2019 that would seek to\nreintegrate Germany into the world economy, proved wanting in\npolitical and economic terms to leading members of the NSDAP. The\nusually persuasive Schacht lost the argument and in the wake of the\nensuing political row, the spoils went to Hermann Goring: the Nazi\nminister, President of Prussia and Commander in Chief of the Luftwaffe\nwas made Plenipotentiary of a Four-Year Plan. Through the plan, Goring\nintended to increase control over Germany\u2019s trade and international\npayments, increase self-sufficiency through a programme of import\nsubstitution, accelerate and intensify the drive for rearmament, and\neliminate any room for independent manoeuvre that German\nbusinessmen still enjoyed. From 1935 onwards, public investment in\nrearmament replaced civilian job creation programmes as the basis\nfor continued expansion.

The efforts of these countries to develop a coordinated response to\nthe depression \u2014 at meetings held in Warsaw in 1930 and at the Stresa\nand World Conferences \u2014 came to nothing (p. 148). Without new\ninternational loans or the revival of international trade (levels of foreign\ntrade in the east were even lower than in the west), the efforts by Britain,\nFrance and Italy to help their particular \u2018friends\u2019 in the region brought\nlittle by way of economic benefits. As the League of Nations reported\nin 1934: \u2018it is hardly an exaggeration to say that foreign lending has\nceased almost entirely!\u2019 Take the experience of Hungary and Bulgaria,\nfor example. From 1929 to 1931 they were still able to import capital\nto the tune of $127 million and $27 million respectively, but by 1933\nthese levels had fallen close to zero. During the first four years of the\ndepression here, as in Germany, the search to renew the confidence of\ninvestors, whether at home or abroad, reinforced membership of the\ngold standard. Financial orthodoxy helps to explain why Czechoslovakia\nand Poland, two of the most industrialized countries to the east, found\nit the hardest to combat the depression. Their failure, in large measure,\nwas due to the strength of their continued commitment to the gold\nstandard. Hungary was the first to abandon the system, albeit informally,\nwhile Albania alone remained on the gold standard until 1939, when\nit was occupied by Italy. However, Czechoslovakia resisted devaluation\nof the crown until 1934 (it had to devalue again in 1936, this time by\n70 per cent), and Poland hung on until 1936 (p. 186). What was left of\neastern Europe\u2019s export trade by 1933 was also damaged by the\ndevaluation of sterling and the US dollar: countries in the region found\ntheir currencies overvalued by around 60 per cent by the end of the\nyear, with all the disadvantages that brought. As a consequence, by\n1933 the export receipts of Bulgaria, Hungary, Poland, Romania and\nYugoslavia, when taken together, had fallen by around 62 per cent of\nthe levels reached in 1929.\n\nGiven the international context, central and eastern Europe\u2019s\nrecourse to protectionism, exchange controls and clearing agreements\nwas largely a defensive act, despite the posturings of political nationalists\nin power at the time. With the notable exception of industrialized\nCzechoslovakia, it was peasant parties which made a distinct\ncontribution to political and economic life, an unsurprising\ndevelopment, given the continued crisis in primary production.\n''"

The Polish\nplans have been described by Ranki and Tomaszewski as: \u2018the first\ngenuine attempt at central planning anywhere in Eastern Europe except\nthe USSR.\u2019 Like Hungary\u2019s \u2018Billion Pengo Plan\u2019 of 1938, the Polish\n\u2018Central Industrial Region\u2019 (COP) was set up as part of the Investment\nPlan and was designed to build up industry in and around the capital\ncity and away from vulnerable national frontiers. The COP contained\naround 15 per cent of Polish territory and a population of five million,\nbut by 1937-38 it accounted for more than 25 per cent of all public\ninvestment and over 50 per cent the following year. (The scheme also\nbenefited from a 2250 million franc loan from its ally France under\nthe Treaty of Rambouillet \u2014 a generous act on the part of France given\nthe upheavals under way in the French economy at the time.) By\nSeptember 1939 the state owned over 100 industrial enterprises,\nincluding 80 per cent of the chemical industry, 40 per cent of iron and\nsteel production, as well as 95 per cent of merchant shipping and all\ntransportation networks. Poland had the highest level of state ownership\nof any country in Europe barring the USSR, and a number of authors\nhave pointed to the strain this exerted on the Polish economy and\nsociety. Moreover, agriculture was largely neglected. In Bulgaria, where\ndefence did not take such a high priority in government planning,\nthere were even grandiose plans for \u2018electrified\u2019 peasant villages,\nconnected by a network of railways, each with a \u2018hall of popular culture\u2019\nanda silo store. The beginnings of recovery, however, did not solve the\npolitical problems of central and eastern Europe. The growing\nintolerance towards Jews, Gypsies, Communists and other so-called\n\u2018non-nationals\u2019 that permeated the nationalist \u2018war\u2019 for recovery was\nespecially troubling.

The gap between east and west\nwidened during the 1930s, while the constraints of financial orthodoxy\nremained strong.

In 1936\nItalian intervention in the Spanish Civil War only increased the\nshortfalls in foreign exchange and raw material supplies, as over the\nnext three years the Italian War and Air Ministries spent some 6 billion\nlire (then around \u00a364 million) on aid to Franco\u2019s forces. A series of\nnew, extraordinary taxes \u2014 on property, share dividends and other\nsources of wealth \u2014 were introduced, but they were not enough to cover\nthe considerable increase in government spending. (By 1938-39 the\nbudget deficit was running at some 12750 million lira.) To make\nmatters worse, that year there were also poor harvests of olives and\nwheat that put even greater pressure on both farmers and the balance\nof trade. These were problems to which the government had no effective\nanswer. Indeed, Mussolini\u2019s agricultural policies have been judged\nlargely to have failed. Their only redeeming feature was a fall in the\nnumber of Italians employed as day labourers (a political irritant to\nthe fascists), thanks, in part, to the opportunities to work on \u2018new\u2019\nland generated by reclamation, one of Mussolini\u2019s pet public-work\nprojects.\n\nThe war in Abyssinia and Spain brought benefits too. It soaked up\nItaly\u2019s remaining surplus labour \u2014 unemployment now fell to pre-\ndepression levels \u2014 as government spending increased, notably on\nmilitary equipment. The demands of the war absorbed the surplus\ncapacity in the Italian economy that had lain idle since the onset of\ndepression; it also generated new capacities, notably in the north of\nItaly. Yet despite further state intervention, notably Mussolini\u2019s claim\nin 1937 that autarky was now the primary goal of national economic\npolicy, the fascist state never really challenged the autonomy of big\nbusiness and, unlike Nazi Germany after 1936, its economic policies\nretained their essentially conservative character. Indeed, it remains an\nuncomfortable fact that some of Italy\u2019s impressive industrial growth\nafter 1945 was thanks to fascist policies.\n\nThe second reason why exchange controls took on a renewed\nsignificance in 1935 was the pressure recovery and war exerted on Italy\u2019s\nforeign exchange reserves \u2014 the same pressures that were at work in\nthe German economy in 1935. One of the government\u2019s more colourful\nresponses to the problem was the \u2018day of the wedding ring\u2019, launched\nin 1936, when the government managed to collect some 400 million\nlira in gold from its people, carried along by a wave of popular\n''"

But taken together, these steps\nwere not enough to shore up Italy\u2019s dwindling reserves. Now it was the\nturn of the Italian central bank to override the rule which insisted\ngold reserves be maintained at 40 per cent of the currency in\ncirculation. While shamelessly continuing to exploit Italy\u2019s membership\nof the gold bloc for propaganda reasons, the facade of gold standard\nmembership had begun to slip. Unlike Germany, however, fascist Italy\nopted to devalue the lira officially in October 1936. The timing makes\nit difficult to assess the impact of devaluation, rising government\nspending or war in isolation. Zamagni has calculated that by the end\nof the year the Italian government had resorted to printing money to\ncover its burgeoning budget deficit \u2014 she estimates that by 1937 over\n30 per cent of the national budget was paid for this way. By 1938\ninflation was on an upward trend. Interestingly, despite the breakdown\nin Franco-Italian relations over events in Spain, the Italian government\nopted to peg the devalued lira to the French franc, a currency that was\nalso devalued in 1936.\n\nThe End of the Gold Bloc: Recovery in Belgium and France\n\nExternal pressures, notably the beggar-thy-neighbour effects of US\ndollar policy, and to a lesser extent sterling\u2019s depreciation, also took\ntheir toll on members of the gold bloc. The strain was greatest on\nBelgium and France which, unlike Germany and other members in\ncentral and southern Europe, had not acted to constrain the impact of\ncurrency flows through exchange controls. The pressure intensified\nwhen, on 31 January 1934, Roosevelt opted to stabilize the dollar at a\ngold price of $35 per ounce (the pound settled at a $5.10 rate). This\nbrought uncertainty regarding the dollar\u2019s exchange rate to an end,\nalthough FDR refused to rule out further dollar depreciation in the\nfuture.

It was not that, as Sauvy alleged, Frenchmen were ignorant\nof economics or misunderstood the implications of Britain and\nAmerica\u2019s departure from the gold standard. We have seen how the\nperception of history shaped the elite, and popular commitment to\ngold produced a coherent, if misguided, interpretation of the origins\nof the depression centred on British and US irresponsibility. The result\nwas a redoubling of French determination to make Britain, America\nand others return to gold, and to play by the rules of the svstem.\n(Ignoring, of course, that French authority to press this case had been\nundermined by France\u2019s failure to play by the rules in the 1920s (p.\n62).) The international dimension of this policy failed in 1933.\nMoreover, claiming the moral high ground on gold made it impossible\nfor France to introduce exchange controls. As a consequence, capital\ncontinued to leave France for safer havens and bank deposits declined.\nThe trend made life difficult for industry and agriculture. By 1934\ngovernment was also having trouble borrowing money, a development\nthat only heightened the pressure for budget cuts to reverse the growing\nproclivity of domestic investors to hoard capital, and to attract foreign\ninvestment back into France. (The same dynamic had shaped Brining\u2019s\npolicies.)\n\nUntil the election of the Popular Front in May 1936, successive French\ncabinets continued to follow the two lines of policy laid down since\n1931: trade protectionism and budget cuts. In 1934 and 1935 the right-\nwing governments of Pierre-Etienne Flandin and Pierre Laval found it\neasy to get new bilateral tariffs, marketing boards and the like through\nthe Chamber of Deputies and the Senate. However, cutting the rising\ndeficit in the national budget \u2014 up from one per cent of national income\nto 3 per cent in 1933 and 4 per cent in 1935 \u2014 was another matter. The\nstrain of pushing legislation to secure renewed cuts in public\nexpenditure took a heavy political toll, prompting 11 changes of cabinet\nfrom 1932 to 1936. As Jackson has demonstrated, the constitutional\narrangements of the Third Republic and bitter party-political rivalries\ndid not help. Nor did the stance of important interest groups. Although\nthe full story of how interest groups shaped the political economy of\ninterwar France remains to be told, Vinen has shown how history and\npolitics combined to generate a culture where big business pulled in\nits horns, by restricting output to maintain prices rather than innovate\nor invest.

Flandin and Laval increasingly resorted to\nextraordinary measures to raise additional revenues for the government\nby borrowing monies from government agencies like post-offices and\nrailways, and setting up new funds to try to entice members of the\npublic with capital to invest it in France (as opposed to hoarding or\nexporting). Caron\u2019s account of the period brings out how, as in 1931\nin central Europe, financial pressures induced these right-wing cabinets\nto increase state-ownership in the economy by coming to the rescue of\ncompanies too important to be allowed to collapse. An involvement in\ntransportation featured strongly. Government became the most\nimportant shareholder in the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Air-France (founded in 1933),\nthe Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Nationale des Chemins de Fer (SNCF, set up in 1937), and\nthe Compagnie G\u00e9n\u00e9rale Transatlantique. Some authors have also\nidentified corporatist tendencies in the French economy.\n\nThe government also rescued several banks, notably the Banque\nNationale de Cr\u00e9dit. Although the problems for French commercial\nbanks were never to become as severe as they had been for Germany,\nAustria or Hungary in 1931, their condition did not compare favourably\nwith commercial banks in Britain. As Lescure demonstrates, French\ncitizens, like their counterparts in Germany, continued to lack\nconfidence in the banks after the inflation of the early 1920s. French\nsavers remained timorous. In 1936, for example, the deposits of the\nCr\u00e9dit Lyonnais equalled 19 per cent of those held by the Midland\nBank in Britain (in 1911 the figure was 89 per cent). France had\nexperienced fewer commercial bank failures in 1931 than many other\ncountries in continental Europe. But after 1934 pressure began to build\nas the economic and monetary health of the country deteriorated, and\nby the end of 1935 the government was having trouble paying the bills\nbecause it had reached the legal limit of its floating debt. Here\nGermany\u2019s remilitarization of the Rhineland actually worked in favour\nof the French economy by prompting the Chamber of Deputies to\nincrease the level set on the government\u2019s floating debt from 15 billion\nto 22.5 billion, largely to be spent on rearmament.\n\nIn the meantime, however, the domestic political struggle over\ndeflation continued to rage, levels of unemployment spiralled and gold\ncontinued to bleed from the coffers of the Bank of France (it lost 3\nbillion francs in April 1936 and 2.7 billion francs in the first week of\nMay).

Their preference was for an international agreement\nin which the franc might be devalued, and then restabilized to make\nthe step palatable to French political and public opinion. France\u2019s\nsearch for an international agreement to cushion the shock of\ndevaluation was also born of international considerations as the French\nTreasury believed the franc\u2019s devaluation, far more than that of sterling\nor the US dollar, would trigger further competitive devaluations.\nWithout the restabilization of sterling, there was every reason to fear\nthat the Bank of England would allow the pound to fall to offset the\nfranc\u2019s decline, in the same way that the sterling bloc had depreciated\nby 8 per cent in 1933 to offset the dollar\u2019s flotation. The French also\nwanted to demonstrate their political alignment with the western\ndemocracies and there was the other members of the gold bloc to\nconsider. If and when the franc left gold, it was very likely that\nSwitzerland, the Netherlands and Poland, too, would succumb to\ncompetitive depreciation.\n\nHowever, neither Britain nor the United States offered much in the\nway of constructive cooperation to help France. Britain did provide a\nloan to help support the gold franc, but like the French loan to Britain\nin the summer of 1931, it was quickly washed away as pressure on the\nfranc mounted in 1936. Cooperation was hampered for the first six\nmonths of 1936 by British reluctance to discuss the restabilization of\nsterling and American unwillingness to take the lead given the tension\nin Anglo-American monetary relations. The French expected better of\nBritish and US politicians and advisors who, for most of 1935, had\nchorused as one that France inevitably was being propelled towards\ndevaluation by its ever-weakening economy. The British and US\nTreasuries calculated that a controlled French devaluation would bring\nmore benefits than trouble to the international economy, but, once\nagain, this recognition did not translate into clear cooperative\ninitiatives. With breathtaking short-sightedness, the British Treasury\nargued there was no need for Britain or America \u2018to make any bargain\nabout stabilization in order to induce France to do what was in her\nown interests\u2019.\u00b0\n\nThe Popular Front marked an important, though by no means clean,\nbreak with the past governments in both its composition and its policies.\nIt was not only the cooperation of socialist, communist and radical\nparties that demonstrated the French Left had learned the lessons of\n''"

Prime Minister L\u00e9on Blum introduced paid vacations, to\nworking-class acclaim, and promised a 40-hour week without a cut in\npay. The measures marked not, as some authors have alleged, the\nsubordination of recovery to the demands of the working class, but\nthe government\u2019s determination to soak up excess capacity and to\nincrease demand within the French economy. So, too, were the plans\ndrawn up for public works, government bonds designed to attract the\nsmall investor and subsidies for agriculture. However, for all the\napparent innovation, historians are broadly critical of the Popular\nFront\u2019s recovery policies, in general, and the introduction of the 40-\nhour week, in particular. Blum and his advisors underestimated the\ncosts to industry of the measure \u2014 it calculated production costs would\nrise by 20 per cent, Asselain argues the figure was closer to 35 per cent\n-or to facilitate the redeployment of workers from areas and industries\nwith high unemployment to sectors experiencing labour shortages.\nThe ideal of the Popular Front had been to reflate the French economy\nwithout devaluing the currency. But the results of its first four months\nin office made it clear devaluation was imperative: levels of production\nand investment fell yet further, unemployment rose and pressure\nmounted on the franc. Unlike Roosevelt\u2019s New Deal, policy innovation\nin France preceded currency devaluation, but France could not escape\nit. It came in September 1936, when the franc was devalued by between\n25 to 33 per cent, but not immediately returned to gold. A recovery of\nsorts followed almost immediately. By January 1937 the value of shares\non the stock market was double that of July 1936 and the number of\nworkers needing financial assistance fell by 70 000. But devaluation was\nnot enough to save Blum\u2019s recovery programme. By February 1937\ninnovation in policy was in abeyance, and by May the economy was once\nmore in a tail spin. Historians, for the most part, continue to be highly\ncritical of Blum\u2019s failure to achieve a lasting improvement in French\nliving standards or levels of productivity (in the coal industry it fell by\n8.5 per cent), although debate has been reinvigorated recently by the\neconometric analyses of Villa who argues that the Popular Front did\nhelp real wages, consumption and even levels of investment in some\nindustries to rise. France\u2019s retreat into imperial trade is an often\nneglected dimension of its policy response to the depression.

But the development, like imperial\npreference for Britain, proved a mixed blessing (p. 195). France\u2019s trade\nbalances were consistently in deficit: taking the empire as a whole, French\nexports in the late 1930s covered only two-thirds of imports, leaving\nFrance with a colonial deficit of around \u00a320 million a year.\n\nSchwartz has also drawn attention to the continued financial pressure\nfaced by the Popular Front. Unlike Britain or the United States,\ndevaluation did not bring an end to the withdrawal of capital from\nFrance. Indeed, in early 1937 the pressure for financial orthodoxy grew\nonly more acute as the focus of government economic strategy shifted\nfrom a preoccupation with recovery to rearmament. Without resorting\nto exchange controls, government policy had to reflect the mindset of\nits investors if it wished to attract and maintain investment in France\nthat was vital in the drive for rearmament. (As Parker has demonstrated,\nspeculative pressure against sterling in 1939 exerted a similar burden\non British rearmament and opened up questions of how far liberal\ncapitalism was compatible with war preparations.) The policies of\nDaladier\u2019s new government, inaugurated in March 1938, provided the\nnecessary, conservative context. Daladier had proved himself the\nchampion of monetary conservatism in 1933 and was able to divert\nattention away from the budget deficit with policies designed to appease\nthe middle classes and stimulate private investment. The 40-hour week\nwas quietly dropped, wage and price controls were introduced to\nprevent inflation and the government mounted a vigorous attack on\ntax evasion and fraud. The French state also became much more\ninvolved in directing production, although we still lack a comprehensive\npicture of the French economy in the final stages of its war preparations.\nDaladier\u2019s government\u2019s anti-communism and union bashing may also\nhave played a role in the return of economic confidence to France \u2014 it\ndeployed troops and military discipline to break up an attempted\ngeneral strike in 1938. There are many bemusing features about life in\nEurope on the eve of the Second World War. One of them is the way\nthat investors, who had withdrawn their capital from France during\n1934 to 1936, returned it in 1938 and 1939 \u2014 at a time when war was\nimminent and the government was engaged in the biggest programme\nof expenditure and deficit financing since the end of the First World\nWar!\n''"

As one monetary bloc appeared to dissolve, so\nanother was formed with the announcement of a tripartite stabilization\nagreement between France, Britain and the United States on 25\nSeptember 1936. An agreement between the leading democracies had\nbeen reached only at the eleventh hour, when it was clear the franc\ncould no longer withstand the speculative pressures and Britain had\ncome round to the view that while it was not prepared to restabilize\nsterling, it would, in effect, offer to \u2018prestabilize\u2019 the pound (hold it\nsteady) to facilitate a moderate devaluation of the franc and to prevent\na further disruptive wave of currency instability.

In an effort to present the Axis powers with the spectacle\nof democratic solidarity, the White House welcomed the agreement as\na \u2018masterpiece of diplomacy and a happy ending to the economic\nwarfare which has been waged by nations which have everything in\ncommon\u2019.\u2019 There was also talk of America initiating a new \u2018World\nRecovery Programme\u2019, a proposal that re-emerged with the economic\nmissions in Europe of the former Belgian President Paul Van Zeeland\nin 1939 and US Assistant Secretary of State Sumner Welles in 1940. Of\ncourse, US rhetoric surrounding the agreement was overblown, but it\ndid mark a concrete beginning to more fruitful economic cooperation\nbetween nations soon to become allies, particularly as the Americans\nbegan to demonstrate a political will for cooperation so miserably\nabsent since 1931.

The road to the\nagreement, from America\u2019s first intimations in 1933 that it desired a\ntrade agreement with Britain, through negotiations that opened in 1936\nto their successful conclusion in November 1938, was paved with mutual\nsuspicion and recrimination. What had changed to cause Britain to\naccept the American proposal it had so firmly rejected in 1933? (p.\n162). The answer lies, in part, in the strains that began to appear in\nBritain\u2019s, hitherto apparently successful, policy response to the\ndepression after 1936. Since 1931 unemployment had fallen, levels of\noutput and trade revived, and its political system remained intact.\nIndeed, the structure of the British political economy remained largely\nunchanged from the 1920s. British industry, unlike its German\ncounterpart, retained its independence, the contribution and needs\nof organized Labour were recognized by government (witness concerns\nabout wage rates and union activity in planning British rearmament),\nand the City of London, if anything, found its role in policy formulation\nreinforced in the wake of sterling\u2019s departure from gold.

By 1937 British exports to the sterling\nbloc had risen to \u00a3308.4 million, overtaking its exports to the rest of\nthe world by some \u00a395.5 million. More impressive was the growth in\nsterling bloc imports into Britain. By 1937 Britain imported over \u00a3491.4\nmillion of sterling bloc produce (including 79 per cent of all South\nAfrican exports and 76 per cent of goods exported by New Zealand).\nBut by 1936 Britain\u2019s persistent trading deficit with other members\nof the sterling bloc, notably those nations covered by imperial\npreference, had become something of a worry. As Cain and Hopkins\nhave demonstrated, until then the trading deficit was tolerated by the\ngovernment, and even welcomed by the City of London, because high\nlevels of imports into Britain enabled bloc members to earn sufficient\nsterling to purchase financial services such as insurance, pay off their\nloans to the City and build up reserves of sterling \u2014 outcomes that\nbolstered the power and prestige of sterling abroad. Indeed, this\nstrategy also helps to explain why the City and the Treasury remained\nanxious that British budgets remained balanced: members in the bloc\nhad to believe sterling was a stable currency and a stable currency\ndemanded financial discipline (p. 133). The most obvious signs of\nfrustration were found among British exporters who were angry that\nmembers of the empire bought less from Britain than they sold\n(enthusiasts of imperial preference had underestimated, in particular,\nthe Dominions\u2019 determination to strengthen their own manufacturing\nindustries), and with the decision of members like New Zealand and\nAustralia to link their currencies to sterling at a new, devalued rate.\nThe sterling bloc also faced new political threats. Aside from the\nestablished problems within imperial relations, like Britain\u2019s healthy\nlevel of food imports from \u2018foreign\u2019 countries like Argentina and\nDenmark, confidence in sterling began to evaporate as war with\nGermany loomed. At the same time, developments in Europe, notably\nthe Czech crisis and the failure of appeasement, also forced Britain to\nface its growing dependence on the United States for imports vital to\nrearmament and, to a lesser extent, the need for political unity among\nthe world\u2019s leading democracies. Politics dictated that Anglo-American\nrelations had to be improved and given the limits on Roosevelt\u2019s ability\nto make foreign policy as he would have wished, a trade deal was the\nbest way to go about it.

It took a full 28 months for an agreement to be reached. By\nNovember 1938, any hope of restraining Hitler with a spectacle of\nAnglo-American solidarity was long lost. Indeed, in October 1938 the\nBritish government\u2019s chief economic advisor told a visiting German\ntrade delegation that the European economy \u2018would be in serious\ndanger if the European Great Powers worked against one another\ninstead of cooperating\u2019 because they were \u201cfaced with the ever-growing\nstrength of the American economy\u2019.?

In 1938 the National Government\u2019s position was\nunderlined by the renewal of the Anglo-German payments agreement\nin July 1938 and its new enthusiasm to conclude cartel agreements\nwith German industrialists to neutralize the threat of revitalized German\ncompetition to hard-pressed British manufacturers.\n\nFor Britain, economic appeasement was not just about resolving the\n\u2018German question\u2019, but also maintaining British power in the face of\nkeen competition from the United States. But despite Britain\u2019s best\nefforts, the strategy failed. By early 1939, the likelihood of war and the\npressures of rearmament had caused Britain to lose more than half its\nforeign exchange reserves. The sterling crisis began to bite as levels of\ninflation rose at home, and international political solidarity counted\nfor little as members of the sterling bloc and Americans, too, tried to\nsell their pounds. The growing monetary crisis increased British\ndetermination to go to war with Germany sooner rather than later.

In the 20 years\nthat followed the First World War, Europe was bedevilled by crises \u2014\neconomic, political and diplomatic \u2014 yet the 20 years that followed the\nSecond World War were the most prosperous and stable of the twentieth\ncentury. While it had taken until 1928 to recapture the degree of\ncurrency stability and levels of international trade enjoyed in 1913, by\n1952 not only had western Europe recovered from the war, but national\neconomies continued to grow at an average rate of 7 per cent a year\nfor the next ten years. This contrast between the two postwar eras is all\nthe more surprising given that the economic costs of fighting the\nSecond World War were even greater than the First. Much more was\nspent on waging war, far more property and infrastructure lay in ruins,\nand, on a global scale, many more people lost their lives through\nwarfare than in the First World War. Across the world around 60 million\npeople died, a figure which includes six million Jews murdered by the\nNazi state.\n\nOnce again, the physical and human losses were not distributed\nevenly. Among the \u2018great\u2019 powers, around whom the conflict revolved,\nthe poorest \u2018great\u2019 power in Europe, the USSR, suffered the greatest\nloss of life and the highest levels of physical destruction: over 25 million\nlives, with 25 per cent of its national assets destroyed.

During the war its gross\nnational product had more than doubled and, in sharp contrast to\n1919, by 1945 it enjoyed the military muscle, diplomatic expertise and\npolitical will for intervention in international affairs.

Reconstructing and recasting\nnational and international economies was central to American planning\nfor the postwar order. There were new organizations designed to\nfacilitate reconstruction and to create and maintain an open world\neconomy: the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development\n(IBRD), otherwise known as the World Bank; the International\nMonetary Fund; and a proposed International Trade Organization.\nAmerica encouraged revised forms of regional cooperation in Europe\ntoo.

There were also favourable domestic economic\nconditions that had nothing to do with government policy.\n\nIt is important to recognize two important caveats in the discussion\nto follow. The first is that \u2014 despite the plans drawn on a national and\ninternational scale, designed to cope with the chaos at war\u2019s end \u2014 for\nthe first two years, European economic recovery was precarious.

The second caveat may seem obvious, but is often\nomitted from assessments of recovery after 1945: the economic success\nof the West was built in a divided Europe. By the end of 1947, the Cold\nWar separated the economies of Western and Eastern Europe (central\nEurope effectively had disappeared).

But, as usual, the British were suspicious of\nthe mismatch between US rhetoric and the reality of its trade policy.\nThe vehemence of America\u2019s professed anti-imperialism also made the\nBritish government nervous, and the issue was further complicated by\nBritish calculations that it would need discriminatory trading practices\nand currency controls to rebuild its economy after the war. Yet for all\nthe time and effort devoted to the planning for an International Trade\nOrganization to implement tariff reductions on a multilateral basis,\nthe ITO failed, not because of European imperialism, but because\nAmerican farmers and industrialists would not accept the end to their\nprotection. Congress destroyed the ITO at birth in 1946. Not for the\nfirst time, US diplomatic rhetoric failed to reflect domestic constraints\nand political circumstances. None the less, the proposed ITO was\nquickly replaced by the General Agreement on Tariff and Trade (GATT)\nwhich worked to promote tariff reductions on the basis of bilateral\nagreements and unconditional MEN.\n\nAlthough assured of greater political support on both sides of the\nAtlantic than the ITO could command, the IMF and the World Bank\nalso got off to a shaky start. When they first opened their doors, these\ninstitutions found themselves overwhelmed by European demands for\nreconstruction funds. In 1947, when recovery faltered, the World Bank\nlent some $753 to Europe as a whole. The loan to France, for example,\nfinanced the construction of two steel mills and helped to buy 113\nlocomotives, 36 cargo vessels, 18 tankers and around 180 smaller craft.\n''"

The sums\nlent to Europe amounted to less than one-twentieth of Marshall aid\nand the bank found it was unable to navigate its way through the\npolitical tensions that surrounded the debate about Europe\u2019s future\nin the early Cold War years. It came to prefer its developmental role in\nAfrica, Asia and Latin America. The early historical record of the IMF\nis little better. Plans for leading currencies to have pegged exchange\nrates (rates were fixed but could be moved up or down within an agreed\nband) and a return to full convertibility came to nothing in the early\nyears. The continued monetary bond between Britain and its sterling\narea partners, in particular, stymied the American aspirations for\nwestern European countries to secure full convertibility with the dollar\nany time soon. (Echoing the re-evaluation of British power in the 1930s,\nrecent accounts of the sterling area have highlighted how, until the\nmid-1950s, sterling, not the US dollar, was the most widely used of all\ninternational currencies.) In the battle for recovery, foreign exchange\nrationing remained widespread in Europe and currency crises fairly\ncommonplace as countries struggled to pay for desperately needed\noverseas imports of food, seeds and machinery, while domestic\nindustries had yet to return fully to a peacetime footing. This tension\npushed balance of payments into the red and triggered currency crises:\nthe year 1949 saw countries in the sterling area and Scandinavia,\nalongside France, Germany, Belgium and Portugal, all devalue their\ncurrencies.\n\nThe early accounts of postwar European history made great play of\nthe role of Bretton Woods and Marshall aid in facilitating economic\nreconstruction, in large part because many of the authors were the\nvery government advisors during the Second World War who studied\nthe failure of the interwar economy and helped to set up these\ninstitutions in the first place: the accounts by Raymond Mikesell,\nWilliam L.

These institutions were\na genuine improvement on the ad hoc, informal and very private\ncooperation between bankers and governments in the interwar period.\nMoreover, it is possible, given the tone and content of these early\naccounts, to view them as prescriptive rather than descriptive histories\n''"

When these\nbooks appeared the United States government was engaged in\n\u2018information\u2019 programmes designed to sell the benefits of economic\ninternationalism to the American people.\n\nIndeed, James\u2019s recent work underlines the important role played\nby the Bretton Woods institutions in the growth of the international\neconomy after 1958. Once the task of reconstruction and recovery in\nEurope was complete and new institutions of western European\neconomic cooperation were inaugurated, the IMF, the World Bank and\nGATT came into their own. They established a code of conduct, and\ninstitutions to safeguard and to promote that code, which facilitated\nan orderly interaction between nation-states when it came to\ninternational economics. It was a far cry from the chaos of gatherings\nlike the World Economic Conference of 1933 intended to facilitate\neconomic cooperation in the interwar period. Although the economic\nand monetary contribution of the IMF and the World Bank to the\ninternational economy did not meet the lofty plans and expectations\nof its architects, in the first 20 years after the war, these institutions\nplayed an important role in smoothing relations between states and in\nproviding a focus for domestic political education. The Bretton Woods\ninstitutions also promoted stringent codes of conduct to liberalize\ninternational monetary and commercial relations which, when state\npolicy fell short (and it often did), acted as a yardstick against which\nnational performance could be measured and compared.\n\nThe early history of GATT was equally unimpressive when set against\nthe more spectacular tariff cuts achieved after 1962, when President\nKennedy responded to the creation of the European Common Market\nby agreeing to across-the-board tariff reductions in order to further\nliberalize world trade. But when compared to the bitter and frustrated\nhistory of negotiations in the interwar period, the achievements of the\nfirst set of negotiations held in Geneva in 1947 were considerable.\nTwenty-three countries, led by the United States but including most of\nwestern Europe, agreed to reduce tariff among themselves, to adhere\nto unconditional MFN and to prohibit quantitative restrictions. In\npractice, however, imperial preference was not outlawed immediately;\nneither were quotas. It was recognized among GATT members that\nquotas were essential, in the short term, at least, to safeguard the fragile\nbalance of payments. Import restrictions were also permitted on\npolitically sensitive commodities, such as fish and agricultural products.\n''"

The economic historian Nick Crafts has\nalso become intrigued by some of Marshall aid\u2019s less conspicuous\nfeatures, notably the scheme providing Technical Assistance that offered\ntechnical expertise to European manufacturers and had a powerful\nimpact on the productivity of recipient countries.\n\nThe final contribution of Marshall aid to European recovery was\nalso its most durable: President Truman\u2019s administration made the\ncoordination of national recovery programmes a precondition for aid.\nThis provision, alongside the European Payments Union (EPU), set\nup to administer payments under the plan, also helped to foster\nEuropean integration. New forms of regional cooperation within\nEurope, very different to those of the interwar period, made an\nimportant contribution to European recovery and growth after 1945.\nThe new regional structures also acted as an important stepping stone\nfrom the nationalism of the 1930s \u2014 reinforced by the need to wage\nwar \u2014 to the global, integrated economy championed by the United\nStates.\n\nDomestic Sources of Recovery\n\nFollowing the Second World War, the rejuvenation of Europe, after\nthe first unsteady splutters in 1945-48, came quickly and durably, in a\nway that it had not done after 1919. By 1952 postwar reconstruction\nhad largely been achieved, yet once property and goods lost through\nwar had been restored, this did not mark the end of European industry\u2019s\n''"

Despite the unprecedented\nscale of destruction caused by the Second World War, the war also\nbrought benefits which helped to facilitate recovery in the first five\nyears afterwards. In particular, the conflict, far more than the First\nWorld War, triggered significant levels of industrial investment,\nespecially in countries that had not been highly industrialized when\nwar broke out. Britain, France, Italy, the USSR and Germany all finished\nthe war with higher stocks of machine tools than before the war had\nbegun.

Moreover, these increased\nlevels of domestic investment were sustained after war\u2019s end and were\nsubstantially higher than in the interwar period.

Once the war was over, however, the legacy of craft production\nstood Germany and Italy in good stead. In the civilian economy, it was\nprecisely the mixture of mass production and skilled, flexible\nproduction patterns that were needed. (The same was true of Japan.)\nIn the years to come, this advantage was accentuated by advances in\ninformation technology. The war also triggered an expansion in the\namount and reliability of statistical information available on the\nperformance of the economy. There were many more trained\neconomists in government, and outside it, during and after the Second\nWorld War than before 1939.\n\nPerhaps the most obvious contrast between war\u2019s end in 1918 and\n1945 was the comparative absence of financial uncertainty. The financial\ninstitutions in capitalist Europe proved robust and wherever signs of\nfinancial chaos appeared, domestic governments, sometimes with US\nhelp, acted quickly to stamp it out. In Belgium, for example, the Finance\nMinister, Camille Gutt, implemented a drastic currency stabilization\nprogramme in October 1944, even before the country had been\nliberated. In September 1945 the Netherlands emulated the Belgian\nmeasure by introducing the Lieftinck Reform, supplemented by a policy\nof price control and continued rationing. As noted above, currencies\nwere not stable, however, new tools of domestic economic management\nand the regional and international context established by Bretton\nWoods, organizations for European economic cooperation and the\nCold War, ensured that inflation did not spiral out of control, as it had\ndone after the First World War. Where essential, exchange controls\nwere maintained without triggering the rivalry and retaliation that had\nsoured economic relations in the 1930s, and US loans, such as that\nadvanced to Britain in 1949 to help stabilize the pound, were secured.\n\nAfter 1952 growth was faster in western Europe (as in Japan) than in\nthe United States, with unprecedented rates of growth, sometimes\naveraging more than 7 per cent a year. In West Germany the\ntransformation became known as the Wirtschaftswunder (Economic\nMiracle), and saw a redefined Germany increase its gross national\nproduct from 98 to 162 points between 1949 and 1954. Italy, too,\nenjoyed its own miracolo economico from 1951 to 1965. The process was\naided by market developments, including a significant growth in\npopulation, and the emergence of a mass-consumer market which\ncreated higher living standards and prosperity for all those in work.\n''"

Indeed, it\ntriggered hot wars outside, beyond Europe\u2019s frontiers, notably in Korea\nin 1950, that generated demand for European produced goods: the\nState Department placed large Offshore Procurement Contracts in\nwestern Europe to strengthen NATO and boost European recovery.\nThe Cold War also produced a system of sorts that helped to stabilize\nrelations within Europe for over 40 years.\n\nA New Regionalism\n\nThe new regional institutions that mushroomed in Europe after 1948\nprovided an important bridge between the full-blown integrated\ninternational economy sought by the planners at Bretton Woods and\nthe continued primacy of the domestic economy, especially strong in\nthe first years after the war.

But the impulse to cooperate\ntook on a definitive and divisive character thanks to the competitive\npressures unleashed by the Great Depression.\n\nThe postwar debate over European cooperation was opened by the\nformer British Prime Minister, Winston Churchill, in a speech in Zurich\nin 1946. However, the real impetus to European cooperation came\nwith the arrival of Marshall aid and the acceleration of the Cold War\nin 1948. The Marshall Plan prompted a radical shift in US economic\nforeign policy. Although the United States remained committed to the\ndrive for a global, integrated economy championed by the Bretton\nWoods institutions, Washington, for economic and political reasons,\nnow advocated economic integration in capitalist Europe. In sharp\ncontrast to the regional structures of the 1930s, which were seen to\nreplace the need for internationalism, regionalism after the Second\nWorld War was conceived as a means to ease Europe\u2019s re-entry into a\nliberal world economy.\n\nAs noted above, the contribution of the European Payments Union\n(EPU) to this process has been the recent focus of much scrutiny by\nscholars. By 1948, the volume of trade between the 16 western European\nnations and the western zones of Germany which made up the OEEC\n(Organization for European Economic Cooperation), the admin-\nistrative body set up to implement the US aid programme, meant they\nwere in debt to one another to the tune of $762 million. At first\ncountries attempted to make payments bilaterally, with the same\ndamaging consequences to trade as those wrought by bilateral\nagreements in the 1930s (p. 122). An important step forward came\nwith the creation of the EPU by the OEEC in September 1950. The\nEPU helped western Europe to break from bilateralism by establishing\na multilateral clearing system. At the end of every month, each member\nof the EPU reported its net balances to the Bank of International\nSettlements, and the EPU ensured that each member country was left\nwith debts and/or credits, not to individual countries, but to the Union\nas a whole. The system brought a large number of benefits. By ensuring\nthat western European countries could pay one another for their\nimports and exports on a broader basis, the EPU led to a rapid\nexpansion of intra-European trade and investment, and underlined\nthat western European industrial economies were complementary\nrather than competitive in their economic structures. Over its lifetime,\nthe EPU settled over $47 billion in debts and credits, banished\nbilateralism and greatly liberalized western European trade. Indeed,\n''"

Although it appeared paradoxical, the EPU, alongside\nother regional organizations in Europe, helped to reinforce the drive\nto internationalism because it established a clear code of conduct (it\nset strict limits on trade quotas for example) and enabled its members\nto manage the needs of the domestic economy in tandem with the\ndrive for greater trade liberalization. The very fact the EPU worked so\nwell encouraged its members to believe that the move towards a global,\nintegrated economy was there to stay and that the commitment of fellow\nmembers to greater liberalization was genuine.\n\nThere were other, positive movements in intra-European economic\ncooperation, most notably in the creation of a Benelux customs union\nin January 1948. Although negotiations were difficult, this regional\ncooperation between Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands\nremoved controls on 90 per cent of trade between the three countries.\nIt was soon mirrored by similar groupings amongst other European\nnations: Sweden, Norway and Denmark formed a group to the North;\nin the Mediterranean there were rumours that Greece and Turkey were\nplanning to form a customs union. These associations were intended\nto promote domestic recovery and afford these traditionally smaller\nEuropean nations a stronger voice in shaping their future than they\nhad enjoyed in the interwar period. In sharp contrast to the 1930s,\nregionalism did not triumph over globalism, it now acted as a stepping-\nstone towards it. Geiger has argued that without the creation of the\nCommon Market, western Europeans might have resisted further trade\nliberalization through GATT.\u00ae At the same time, it was the very\neffectiveness of these regional institutions, that encouraged President\nKennedy to initiate one of the most successful GATT rounds in the\nagreement's history.\n\nFrom the outset, almost all states in western Europe, as now defined\nby the \u2018East-West\u2019 conflict of the Cold War, favoured \u2018functional\ncooperation\u2019 over plans for political federation.

There was also a greater appreciation of the\nvalue of regional cooperation as a bridge between the national and\ninternational political economy, and of the benefits to be had from\neducating public opinion as to the need for cooperation. In all this\nthe Cold War undoubtedly played an important part. Comparing the\npostwar period to the interwar period as a whole, economic historians\nare agreed that growth and stability came readily after 1945 thanks to\nthe benefits of regulated exchange rate flexibility, the huge expansion\nof multilateral trade and institutionalized international cooperation\non finance and trade. In Europe the economic lessons of the interwar\nperiod were repeated again with the end of the Cold War in 1990. In\n''"

Report of the Preparatory Commission for the World Economic\nConference, November 1932, reprinted in The Economist, 10 June 1933, p.\n6:\n\n2. The Cold War has led to considerable confusion in the literature as to\nthe boundaries of Europe. The term \u2018central\u2019 Europe is now rarely seen,\nwhile Eastern Europe begins at Germany\u2019s eastern border. This text\nattempts to be sensitive to this problem without explicitly addressing it.\n\n3. One further point of definition may be helpful here regarding the term\n\u2018devaluation\u2019. Today, \u2018devaluation\u2019 is taken to mean the decrease in the\nvalue of a currency relative to other currencies, then its restabilizing at a\nnew, fixed level. The failure to refix the currency price on gold is called\ncurrency depreciation or flotation. Back in the interwar period, however,\nany diminution of the legal foreign value of a currency was called\n\u2018devaluation\u2019, while the process as a whole was called \u2018depreciation. For\nthe sake of clarity, I have adopted the modern usage throughout.\n\n4. The role played by financial considerations in Britain\u2019s appeasement of\nNazi Germany is a classic example.\n\n5. See P. Temin\u2019s 1989 call, Lessons from the Great Depression (Cambridge, MA,\n1989) sp. 17\n\n1 Frustrated Expectations, 1919-24\n\n1. J. A.

Williamson, Karl Helfferich, 1872-1924 (Princeton, NJ, 1971), p. 129.\n\n4. This appears in C. P.

Eichengreen\u2019s more\nrecent calculations in Golden Fetters: The Gold Standard and the Great\nDepression, 1919-39 (Oxford, 1992), p. 85, are based on the 1938 estimates\n\n216\n''"

Temin and G. Toniolo, The European Economy Between the\nWars (Oxford, 1997). Also useful is R. Munting and B. A. Holderness,\nCrisis, Recovery and War: An Economic History of Continental Europe, 1918-\n1945 (Hemel Hempstead, 1991), although this study omits Britain. F.\nB. Tipton and R. Aldrich, An Economic and Social History of Europe, 1890\n\u2014 1939 (London, 1987) brings out the social dimension; while M. Kitch-\nen, Europe between the Wars (London, 1992) is probably the best concise\nsurvey of the political history of the period. For an introduction into\nthe international economy of the period, J. Foreman-Peck, A History of\nthe World Economy: International Economic Relations Since 1850 (London,\n1983, 1986) is always reliable, although a little dated. For a more up-\nto-date survey, see A. G. Kenwood and A. L. Lougheed, The Growth of\nthe International Economy, 1820-1990, ( 3rd edn, London, 1992).\n\n2 Studies of the Great Depression\n\nThere is no study which focuses exclusively on the history of the Great\nDepression in Europe. Nor does any single account bring out the po-\nlitical, economic and social history of the crisis in equal measure; the\ntotal history of the Great Depression in Europe remains to be written.\nThe dominant perspective is, quite rightly, global. Here, the work of\nB. Eichengreen is essential. See B. Eichengreen, Golden Fetters: The Gold\nStandard and the Great Depression, 1919-1939 (Oxford, 1992), and his\nsummary of current work on the depression, entitled \u201cThe Origins and\nNature of the Great Slump Revisited\u2019, Economic History Review, 45:2\n(1992).

Drummond\u2019s short book, The Gold\nStandard and the International Monetary System, 1900-1939 (Basingstoke,\n1987), remains a useful introduction to the topic. While the central\nthesis of C. P. Kindleberger\u2019s magisterial, The World in Depression, 1929-\n39 (Harmondsworth, 1974, 1987) has been challenged, this remains\nthe most readable account of the crisis. The most recently published\nstudy is T. E. Hall and J. D. Ferguson, The Great Depression: An Interna-\ntional Disaster of Perverse Economic Policies (Ann Arbor, MI, 1998). Paul\nKrugman offers a spirited defence of \u2018managed inflation\u2019 and relates\nthe crisis of 1929-33 to Asia\u2019s Crash in the 1990s in The Return of Depres-\nsion Economics (London, 1999). Studies of trading patterns in the\nperiod are in shorter supply. Still useful is P. L. Yates, Forty Years of\nForeign Trade: A Statistical Handbook with Special Reference to Primary Prod-\nucts and Underdeveloped Countries (London, 1959); and M. Tracy\u2019s work\non agriculture. See M. Tracy, Government and Agriculture in Western Eu-\nrope, 1888-1999 (3rd edn, London, 1989). Important contributions to\nour understanding of the timing of the crisis have been made P. Temin\nand T. Balderston, \u2018The Beginning of the Depression in Germany, 1927\u2014\n30: Investment and the Capital Market\u2019, Economic History Review, 36\n(1983). Important, too, are H. James, \u2018Financial Flows Across Fron-\ntiers in the Great Depression\u2019, Economic History Review, 45:3 (1992);\nand W. C. McNeil, American Money and the Weimar Republic: Economics\nand Politics on the Eve of the Great Depression (New York, 1986). For a\nstudy that assesses the impact of debt and the depression, see H. Fleisig,\n\u2018War Related Debts and the Great Depression\u2019, American Economic Re-\nview, 66 (1976); while the liveliest study of the Wall Street Crash remains\nJ. K. Galbraith, The Great Crash, 1929 (Harmondsworth, 1987).\n\nFor further details on the impact and character of the financial cri-\nsis of 1931, see H. James, \u201cThe Causes of the German Banking Crisis,\n1931\u2019, Economic History Review, 37 (1984); and R. Glenn Hubbard (ed.),\nFinancial Markets and Financial Crises (Chicago, IL, 1991). H.

B. von Kruedener (ed.), Economic Crisis and Political Collapse:\nThe Weimar Republic, 1924-1933 (Oxford, 1990).

Balderston,\nThe Origins and Course of the German Banking Crisis, 1923-1932 (Berlin,\n1993). Debate regarding the failure of the Weimar Republic recently\nhas returned to a preoccupation with the political reasons for its col-\nlapse. See G. D. Feldman, \u2018Hitler\u2019s Assumption of Power and the\nPolitical Culture of the Weimar Republic\u2019, German Politics and Society,\n14: 1.

Overy, The Nazi Economic Recovery, 1932-38 (2nd\nedn, Cambridge, 1995), and War and Economy in the Third Reich (Ox-\nford, 1994). W. Abelshauser provides a lucid appreciation of both how\nGermany recovered from depression and the contribution of the Ger-\nman war economy to the postwar Wirtschafiswunder in \u2018Germany: guns,\nbutter and economic miracles\u2019, in M. Harrison (ed.), The Economics of\nWorld War II: Six Great Powers in International Comparison (Cambridge,\n1998), pp. 122-76. The contribution by H. E. Volkmann, in W.

One of the best works on the relationship between\nindustry and the National Socialists\u2019 rise to power remains, J. Turner,\nGerman Big Business and the Rise of Hitler (Oxford, 1987). However, the\nlast ten years has seen a large number of more detailed studies come\nto light, including P. Hayes, Industry and Ideology: IG Farben in the Nazi\nEra (Cambridge, 1987); and B. P. Bellon, Mercedes in Peace and War:\nGerman Automobile Workers, 1903-1945 (New York, 1990). J.

It is the only\navailable study to focus exclusively on Europe, where its impact was\nenormous: unemployment was rampant as industrial production fell\nby 40 per cent, primary prices dropped by 30 per cent, and some of\nthe most respected banks teetered on the brink of collapse. The\neconomic depression also had profound consequences for domestic\npolitics and international relations. It triggered mass support for\nfascist and communist parties, and divided the world into competing\neconomic blocs that helped to pave the road to war in 1939.\n\nWritten with the non-economist in mind, the book focuses on four\ncentral questions: What were the origins of the depression? Why was\nit So Severe? How far, and in what ways, did the European economy\nrecover? And what were the implications of that recovery for political\nrelations in, and between, nations?\n\nThe book examines recent research into the causes of the depression,\nnotably the role of the gold standard \u2018system\u2019. It gives equal weight\nto the political and historical context of economic policy \u2014 political\nattitudes, institutional opinions, strategic considerations, the \u2018legacies\nand lessons\u2019 of history \u2014 to explain the magnitude of the crisis.\nInternational cooperation offered the best chance for recovery. Using\na wide range of archival sources, the book also contains a lively\naccount of why this failed and its consequences for international\nrelations in the 1930s.\n\nPatricia Clavin is Senior Lecturer in Modern History at the University\nof Keele.\n\nIllustration: Edgar Ende's 1933 painting Die Barke can be seen as a representation of\n\na society that had hitched itself to a 'golden' economic system in the hope of improving\n\nits lot, only to find it brought yet more misery.
