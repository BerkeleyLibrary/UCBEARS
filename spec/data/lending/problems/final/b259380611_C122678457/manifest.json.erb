              "value": "PREFACE\n\nABOUT THE BOOK\n\nAccounting fraud, or the manipulation of financial statements, has become an increas-\ningly serious issue over the last two decades, leading to the collapse of ostensibly solid\ncompanies, exacerbating a serious global recession, and resulting in an acute lack of confi-\ndence in financial markets and in the accuracy of financial statements. This book provides\nan informative and invaluable analysis of the Top 20 Methods of Fictitious Financial\nReporting that lists the most frequently used methods of overstating earnings and assets\nand understating debt in financial statements. The book also presents a detailed examina-\ntion of the main Signals indicating possible fictitious reporting in financial statements.\nTaking the viewpoint that no book on accounting fraud would be complete without an\nexamination of the breakdown in ethics that underlies the fraud, this text examines the\nthree major Theories of Ethics, as well as ethical decision-making models that are appli-\ncable to the business world in general and to students of accounting in particular.\n\nDetecting Accounting Fraud: Analysis and Ethics takes the following eight-step\ncase-study approach:\n\n1. Identifies the accounting fraud or method of fictitious financial reporting\nutilized by a specific, real-world company.\n\n2. Presents background information about the company and its key executives.\n\n3. Describes the fraud or scheme in detail, referencing the company’s financial\nstatements as well as primary documents such as Accounting and Auditing\nReleases, Litigation Releases, SEC Complaints, and Bankruptcy Reports.\n\n4. Explains how a particular accounting scheme or fraud leads to specific signals\nin the company’s financial statements indicating that these financial statements\nhave been manipulated.\n\n5. Asks students to address relevant ethical issues in the “Ethics at Work” sections\nthroughout the book.\n\n6. Provides short, end-of-chapter questions to ascertain that students have under-\nstood the material.\n\n7. Provides in-depth discussion questions and exercises to encourage a more com-\nprehensive grasp of the material.\n\n8. Presents a new, real-world case study of another company that perpetrated\nan accounting fraud or scheme similar to that discussed earlier in the chapter.\nStudents are provided with extracts from this new company’s financial state-\nments, as well as relevant excerpts from original documents such as Litigation\nReleases and Complaints. Students are then given the opportunity to identify\nsignals in this company’s financial statements indicating how the company has\nmanipulated its financial statements.\n\nxvii\n''"

Schapiro, then chairman of the United States Securities\nand Exchange Commission (SEC), described the vast damage caused by the financial\ncrisis and went on to point out: “One of the fundamental requirements for rational\ninvesting and efficient capital formation is the availability of high quality information.\nOne of our core functions is collecting and making publicly available financial and\nother relevant information from public companies.” The health of our markets—and\nthe very foundation of our financial system—trelies on the production and accessibility\nof this “high quality” financial information.\n\nUnfortunately, as a review of the last 15 years reveals, the financial informa-\ntion from a variety of public companies that were once regarded as mainstays of\nthe U.S. economy was naively misleading at best and blatantly fraudulent at worst.\nNumerous executives have been exposed in cases of greed and betrayal, of blatant\nduplicity and moral bankruptcy. Central to almost every case discussed in this book\nis the fact that these corporate executives manipulated financial statements—or\nencouraged others to tamper with financial statement disclosures—and misled those\nwho trusted them.\n\nWHAT IS ACCOUNTING FRAUD?\n\nBefore addressing accounting fraud, it is helpful to briefly examine the concept of fraud\nin general. Defining fraud is a complex legal exercise, and definitions may differ from\nstate to state, from federal courts to state courts, and from criminal cases to civil cases.\nThis discussion addresses the issue in broad terms and is not meant to be taken as\nlegal advice. The Association of Certified Fraud Examiners describes fraud as follows:\n\nIn practice, fraud embraces all the multifarious means that human ingenuity\ncan devise for one person to gain an advantage over another by false sugges-\ntion or suppression of the truth. No final, invariable rule can be laid down in\ndefining fraud—according to Black’s Law Dictionary, the act of fraud includes\nsurprise, trick, cunning, and a range of unfair ways by which people are\ncheated. The only boundaries are those that limit human knavery. (The Fraud\nTrial, 2011, p. 6)\n\nAccording to Lawrence and Wells (2004), “Under common law, three elements are\nrequired to prove fraud: a material false statement made with an intent to deceive..., a\nvictim’s reliance on the statement and damages.” The Federal Bureau of Investigation\n(FBI) defines fraud as follows: “The intentional perversion of the truth for the purpose\nof inducing another person or other entity in reliance upon it to part with something of\nvalue or to surrender a legal right” (www.fbi.gov).\n''"

              "value": "Chapter 1 ¢ Introduction to the Problem of Accounting Fraud\n\nAccounting fraud (also sometimes called “corporate fraud’” or “financial report-\ning fraud”) is a particular type of fraud that involves the manipulation of financial\nstatements. In its report on Deterring and Detecting Financial Reporting Fraud (2010), the\nCenter for Audit Quality defines financial reporting fraud as “a material misrepresenta-\ntion resulting from an intentional failure to report financial information in accordance\nwith generally accepted accounting principles” (p. i).\n\nFor criminal fraud cases, the burden of proof (or level of proof) required is gener-\nally higher than for civil fraud cases: “For civil cases that burden is a ‘preponderance of\nevidence.’ In criminal fraud the standard is ‘beyond a reasonable doubt’” (Lawrence &\nWells, 2004). For this reason, many cases of accounting fraud are tried in civil court or\nresult in civil actions such as SEC enforcement actions.\n\nCivil Accounting Fraud\n\nThe Enforcement Division of the SEC publishes “financial reporting related enforce-\nment actions concerning civil lawsuits brought by the Commission in federal court\nand notices and orders concerning the institution and/or settlement of administrative\nproceedings” (“Accounting and Auditing Enforcement Releases”). The SEC issues its\nfindings in the form of an Accounting and Auditing Enforcement Release (AAER) or\na Litigation Release (LR) or both. In an AAER or LR, the SEC describes how a com-\npany has allegedly infringed securities law. The SEC will usually accept an “Offer of\nSettlement,” and the respondents agree to the “Order Instituting Public Administrative\nand Cease and Desist Proceedings.” The respondents generally do not admit or deny\nthe findings.\n\nAfter the Sarbanes-Oxley (SOX) Act was passed in 2002, SEC enforcement\nactions increased from 598 in fiscal year 2002 (Dickey, Sturc, & Van Lobels Sels, 2003)\nto 679 actions in fiscal 2003. The next few years saw a slowdown in cases, until the\nfinancial crisis hit the economy to cause another upswing in enforcement actions. As\ncan be seen in Figure 1.1 (below), the SEC’s Enforcement Actions cover a range of finan-\ncial violations, such as insider trading, market manipulation, and securities offering\nviolations in addition to financial fraud/issuer disclosure violations. The category of\n“Financial Fraud /Issuer Disclosure” (i.e., accounting fraud) involves violations related\nto financial statements and financial disclosures released by “issuers” of financial state-\nments. These are the types of violations that we examine in this text.\n\nThe crisis of 2008 shifted the focus of SEC enforcement investiga-\ntions and actions away from accounting and issuer disclosure violations for a\nfew years. According to an article in The Wall Street Journal, it is expected that\n\n \n\n\"While not all corporate fraud is accounting fraud, accounting fraud is the most prevalent and most damaging\nform of corporate fraud.

Clearly, in spite of increased regulations, accounting fraud remains\na serious and persistent problem.\n\nACCOUNTING FRAUD AT THE TURN OF THE MILLENNIUM\n\nAt the turn of the millennium, the nation’s attention was focused on the dangers of ficti-\ntious financial reports and the shortcomings of the financial reporting system as a result\nof the spectacular business and financial reporting failures of Enron and WorldCom.\n\nEnron and WorldCom\n\nIn an Amended Complaint (May 1, 2003) charging Enron executives with fraud, the\nDeputy Director of the Enforcement Division of the SEC, Linda Chatman Thomsen,\ndeclared:\n\nAt a point when Enron’s touted groundbreaking broadband technology was little\nmore than a concept—and its business model was not commercially viable—these\ndefendants played important roles in perpetuating the fairy tale that Enron was\ncapable of spinning straw—or more appropriately, fiber—into gold.\n\nWithin weeks of the beginning of Enron’s meltdown in mid-October 2001,\nemployees had lost over a billion dollars’ worth of Enron stock in their 401(k) plans,\nstockholders had lost billions of dollars as the stock price fell from $60 per share to\nbelow $1, and debt holders were about to lose more than $3.9 billion that Enron owed\nthem. On December 3, 2001, about 4,000 of Enron’s employees were given notice to\nleave the company on the same day.\n\nUnfortunately, Enron’s accounting fraud was just one more case in an all-too-\nfrequent litany of falsified financial reports that had grown in incidence over the 1990s\nand into the 21st century, when accounting fraud seemed to reach pandemic proportions.\nWorldCom’s bankruptcy was soon to follow in 2002, and staggeringly, it topped Enron’s”.\n\nIn his First Interim Report (2002), Richard Thornburgh, WorldCom’s Bankruptcy\nExaminer, presented a list of the gatekeepers who failed WorldCom. Thornburgh\nfound failure by WorldCom’s management and senior accounting staff and its inter-\nnal control system, as well as failed checks and balances by the following gatekeepers:\n\n¢ The board of directors, including general oversight failure as well as failures by\nthe audit committee and the compensation and stock option committee\n\ne The internal audit department\n\n¢ The external auditors\n\n¢ The investment banking company\n\n¢ The investment banker’s stock analyst\n\n \n\n*However, six years later, in September 2008, Lehman Brothers became the largest bankruptcy in U.S.\nhistory and Washington Mutual became the second largest. WorldCom dropped to third place, and Enron's\nbankruptcy fell to sixth on the list (Ovide, 2011).\n''"

Why did these checks and balances fail? What were the factors that\nled to such widespread allegations of accounting fraud?\n\nStock Options\n\nBecause management has ultimate responsibility for the preparation of a company’s\nfinancial statements, it is not surprising that the huge rise in the incidence of fraudu-\nlent financial reporting enforcement actions at the turn of the millennium was associ-\nated with huge increases in incentives for management to present financial statements\nthat overstated earnings. Time and time again, the SEC’s AAERs alleged that manage-\nment orchestrated frauds to meet Wall Street analysts’ earnings expectations. In most\ncases, senior management compensation agreements included stock options that\nwould provide significant additional remuneration if analysts’ earnings expectations\nwere met.\n\nFormer SEC chairman Arthur Levitt (2002) told of the losing battle that he fought\nwhen he tried to pass measures that he believed would cool the dramatic increase in\nthe granting of stock options as a major form of executive compensation. As SEC chair-\nman, Levitt had seen firsthand the temptations created by massive options grants.\nLevitt thought that if companies had to expense the value of stock options given to\nexecutives as compensation, the decrease in earnings reported in the income statement\nwould dampen shareholders’ willingness to agree to awarding stock options as an\never-increasing form of executive compensation.\n\nBy 2001, a troubling 80 percent of top management compensation “was in the\nform of stock options” (Levitt, 2002, p. 111). In an article by Byrne, Lavelle, Byrnes,\nand Vickers in May 2002, Business Week reported that in 2001, “CEOs of large corpora-\ntions made 411 times as much as the average factory worker.” This was up dramatically\nfrom the 1970s when CEOs had earned only about 20 times more than average workers\n(Weissmann, 2013). With the lure of tantalizing riches from stock options, many top\nexecutives could not resist the temptation to present financial statements that satisfied\nWall Street’s earnings expectations.\n\nExternal Auditors\n\nAt the same time that stock options were growing rapidly as a component of executive\ncompensation, Levitt was also fighting a losing battle against another growing trend\nthat concerned him. External auditors were collecting ever-escalating consulting fees\nfrom the same clients for whom they performed “independent” audits. At the begin-\nning of 2002, an article in Business Week confirmed that consulting fees for external\nauditors were spiraling: “That accountants have become increasingly dependent on\nconsulting is clear.... In 1993, 31% of the industry’s fees came from consulting. By 1999,\nthat had jumped to 51%.” It may be a matter of debate whether keeping the audit\n''"

Clearly, many\nauditors could not take the increased pressure from management who stood to gain\nsignificantly from fraudulent financial reports. Business Week summed it up as follows:\n“Still, in many people’s minds the rising importance of consulting has contributed to a\ndecline in auditor skepticism. It simply looks bad to have Andersen earning more on\nconsulting to Enron than on auditing.” (Quotes from Nanette Byrnes et al., 2002)\n\nTogether with condemnation for accepting increasing consulting fees from audit\nclients, the auditing environment faced other tough criticisms at the time of the colos-\nsal reporting failures. The self-policing practices of the auditing profession came under\nscrutiny. Since 1977, the Public Oversight Board (POB) had been responsible for moni-\ntoring audit independence and quality. However, this board did not have the power to\nsubpoena, nor did it have any real power to punish wrongdoers, and with the onslaught\nof accounting frauds, the American Institute of CPAs (AICPA) came to loggerheads with\nthe oversight board. The board ceased to exist in May 2002.* The AICPA also had a peer\nreview system, but “no Big Five? firm [had] ever failed a review” (Nanette Byrnes et al.,\n2002). Regrettably, the oversight division lacked the weapons to protect its domain.\n\nFurthermore, as scrutiny of the Enron failure showed, independent auditors\nwould frequently leave the auditing profession and join the staff of a company that they\nhad audited. Clearly, there was often too much familiarity and camaraderie between a\nformer employee of an audit firm and the external auditors, making it difficult for the\nexternal auditors to remain entirely independent.\n\nFinally, audit firms usually audited the same companies year after year, develop-\ning friendships with management, growing complacent, and sometimes dropping their\nguard. Mandatory rotation of auditors could have prevented them from losing their\nindependence in at least two ways: First, the forced rotation would have precluded\nthe audit firms from building too much familiarity. Second, knowing that a new firm\nwould be arriving the following year and reviewing the work papers and the client’s\nfinancial statements would have been an added incentive for external auditors to resist\nmanagement’s pressure to compromise their audits.\n\nBoards of Directors\n\nIn attempting to address yet another corporate governance concern, Levitt (2002)\nfocused his attention on both chummy and absentee members of companies’ boards\nof directors. In his book Take on the Street, Levitt discussed the many directors who\nlacked independence, as well as those directors who were indifferent and had no inter-\nest in company activities. Levitt also observed that there were too many “inside” direc-\ntors who were company employees and that there were too few “outside” directors.\n\n \n\n* The POB was replaced by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB), which was created\nby the SOX Act of 2002.\n\n° The Big Five became the Big Four after the collapse of Arthur Andersen in 2002.\n''"

All of these situations could, and\noften did, influence a director’s autonomy in overseeing the direction of the company.\nLevitt (2002) described some of the responsibilities of a board of directors:\n\nOne of its responsibilities is to advise the CEO and the top executive team with\nimpartial common sense and various kinds of expertise. The board should meet\nregularly to discuss such issues as the ongoing health of the business, the current\nmanagement team and its performance, the compensation of the top executives,\nand the future outlook of the company. (pp. 207-208)\n\nTypical of many boards in the late 1990s and into the new millennium,\nWorldCom’s board was criticized by the Bankruptcy Examiner for not monitoring the\noutrageous, unfocused growth of WorldCom. In addition, the board’s compensation\ncommittee came under scrutiny for its “generosity” to the CEO, Bernard Ebbers. The\naudit committee of WorldCom’s board of directors was scrutinized for its lax supervi-\nsion of accounting issues.\n\nInvestment Bankers\n\nThornburgh, WorldCom’s Bankruptcy Examiner, also criticized WorldCom’s investment\nbanker, Salomon Smith Barney (SSB), and its star analyst, Jack Grubman. Thornburgh\ndescribed SSB’s distribution of coveted “Friends of the Company” IPO shares to Ebbers,\nWorldCom’s CEO. Thornburgh then revealed the correlation between the allotments\nof these shares to Ebbers and WorldCom’s allocation of investment banking work to\nSSB. Grubman was under pressure to provide favorable reports on certain companies in\norder for SSB to obtain more investment banking business from them. This was not an\nisolated problem. Arthur Levitt (2002) reported: “In April 2002, the Justice Department,\nSecurities and Exchange Commission, and state regulators opened investigations of pos-\nsible wrongdoing by research analysts at major Wall Street firms” (p. 65). These inves-\ntigations were prompted by subpoenaed e-mails that seemed to confirm many rumors:\n\nWall Street analysts often recommended to investors shares of companies that\nhave an investment banking relationship with their firm; yet privately, analysts\nderide these same companies.... [A Merrill Lynch analyst] in one e-mail referred\nto a company that he had bullishly recommended as “a piece of junk.” (Levitt,\n2002, p. 65)\n\nIn the rush to jump on the bandwagons of IPOs, hot dot-coms, and other\nget-rich-quick schemes, many investment bankers and analysts lost their indepen-\ndence, their impartiality, and their ability to provide their clients with sound and objec-\ntive investment advice. Analysts’ reports on the results of their research into companies\nbecame one more gatekeeping function that could not be relied upon. The promise of\nlucrative investment banking work may have been the driving force behind an upgrade\nof a company’s stock, and signals that the financial statements might be fraudulently\nprepared may have been ignored ... for a fee.\n''"

Once again, Enron and WorldCom were symptomatic of the recurrent prob-\nlems of inadequate and flawed systems of internal controls, as well as indicative of under-\nstaffed internal audit departments that came under the authority of the very managers\nthey were meant to audit. The responsibility of management to institute controls ensuring\nthe integrity of the accounting information captured was not clearly defined. The duties\nof the external auditors regarding the system of internal control were not well specified.\nAlthough members of WorldCom’s internal audit department were finally instrumental\nin uncovering the financial reporting frauds and reporting them to the board of directors,\nWorldCom’s Bankruptcy Examiner faulted both the company’s system of internal controls\nand the understaffing of its internal audit department. It was also problematic that the\ninternal audit department ultimately reported to the CFO, Scott Sullivan, who was the\nmajor originator of the tall tales underlying WorldCom’s accounting fraud.\n\nSuch was the financial reporting environment at the turn of the 21st century as the\nmanagement of so many companies, blinded by the lure of stock option riches, reck-\nlessly pushed and pressurized everyone in the system to go along with the fabricated\nfinancial statements. What happened to WorldCom and Enron was the result of a seri-\nously flawed financial reporting environment that permitted all of their gatekeepers to\nfail them in the same ways that hundreds of other companies’ custodians failed their\nstakeholders. The frauds were not limited to any particular industry or sector of the\neconomy, nor were they limited to just a couple of varieties of sham reporting. The\nsuspect companies ranged from medical corporations to theatrical companies, from\nmanufacturers of kitchen electrics to conglomerates that sold electricity. In the five-\nyear period ending July 30, 2002, the SEC filed 515 enforcement actions against “164\nentities and 705 individuals” (SOX Report, 2002, p. 1).\n\nIn an attempt to deal with the morass of corporate problems and the huge public\noutcry, in July 2002, Congress passed the Public Company Accounting Reform and\nInvestor Protection Act of 2002, also known as the Sarbanes-Oxley Act or the SOX Act.\n\nTHE SARBANES-OXLEY ACT OF 2002\n\nThe major goals of the SOX Act are “to enhance corporate responsibility, enhance\nfinancial disclosures and combat corporate and accounting fraud, and [create] the\n‘Public Company Accounting Oversight Board,’ also known as the PCAOB, to oversee\nthe activities of the auditing profession” (“The Laws ...,” 2012). The PCAOB “ended\nmore than 100 years of self-regulation by the public company audit profession” (“The\nSarbanes-Oxley Act at 10,” 2012).\n\nThis act—sponsored by Senator Paul Sarbanes (D-Md.) and Congressman Michael\nOxley (R-Ohio)—was intended to restore what Senator Sarbanes called the “fundamental\nintegrity” of U.S. markets. Initially, some ardent supporters of the legislation regarded it as\na type of magic potion, a cure-all for the problems plaguing the corporate world. Although\nit was drawn up and passed quite rapidly, it took several years, countless squabbles, and\nmany millions of dollars for the various facets of the SOX Act to be implemented.\n''"

The question of corporate\ncompensation—only partially addressed by the SOX Act—remains another difficult\nissue with no easy answers in a free market economy. A 2013 report published by\nthe Institute for Policy Studies points out: “The pay gap between CEOs and average\nAmerican workers has grown from 195-to-1 in 1993 to 354-to-1 in 2012” (Anderson,\nKlinger, & Pizzigati, 2013).\n\nThe SOX Act also had its quirky side with some unexpected consequences.\nFor example, Section 301 of SOX mandated the establishment of hotlines for\nanonymous whistleblowers. This caused problems for some U.S. companies with\nEuropean subsidiaries because very few countries in Europe have laws that protect\nwhistleblowers.\n\nIn spite of the glitches encountered implementing SOX, the reform was a rational\nresponse to problems that endangered the fundamental stability of our capital markets.\nIn addition to the SEC’s efforts to fulfill the requirements of the SOX Act, a number\nof other organizations set to work to clean up the corporate environment and create\ngreater financial statement transparency.° For example:\n\n¢ The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued or updated several\naccounting standards.\n\n¢ The PCAOB developed an extensive inspection program.\n\n¢ The New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and the National Association of Securities\nDealers Automated Quotations (NASDAQ) added new requirements for their\nmember companies.\n\n¢ The Department of Justice made corporate fraud a priority, with increased penal-\nties for corporate fraud and other corporate crimes.\n\n¢ Business schools from coast to coast established courses in business ethics and\ncorporate governance issues.\n\n¢ An ongoing project was launched to integrate U.S. generally accepted accounting\nprinciples (GAAP) with international financial reporting standards (IFRS).\n\nSome of the main areas of corporate governance reform as a result of the SOX Act\nof 2002 included the following:\n\n¢ Internal control requirements (SOX Section 404)\n\n¢ Responsibilities of corporate management (SOX Section 302)\n¢ Loans to executives\n\n¢ Independence and oversight of external auditors\n\n¢ Audit committees\n\n¢ Independence of boards of directors\n\n¢ Independence of analysts\n\n¢ Corporate crime enforcement\n\n \n\n° Information in this section is mainly from Glassman (2005).\n\n11\n''"

Section 404(a)\n“requires management to report on the effectiveness of the company’s internal controls\nover financial reporting, and Section 404(b) requires the auditor’s attestation regard-\ning their effectiveness” (“The Sarbanes-Oxley Act at 10,” 2012). In response to some of\nthe criticisms, changes have been made to Section 404(b). The Dodd-Frank Act of 2010\neliminated certain Section 404(b) requirements for public companies “with less than $75\nmillion in market capitalization,” and the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (JOBS\nAct) of 2012 granted a five-year postponement to “certain emerging growth compa-\nnies” after an initial public offering (Amato, 2012). Former Senator Sarbanes referred to\nthe JOBS Act exemptions as “a scandal waiting to happen” (qtd. in Amato, 2012).\n\nIn a 2012 statement, the American Institute of CPAs came out in firm support of\nSection 404(b): “The AICPA has consistently urged implementation of Section 404(b)\nfor all publicly held companies. It has led to improved financial reporting and greater\ntransparency, and the AICPA believes all investors in public companies should have\nequal benefit of the same protections” (Melancon, 2012).\n\nResponsibilities of Corporate Management (Section 302 of SOX)\n\nSection 302 requires that the chief executive officers (CEOs) and the chief financial\nofficers (CFOs) of public companies assume responsibility for certifying specific areas of\n“each annual or quarterly report filed or submitted” to the SEC. The Executive Summary\nof the Sarbanes-Oxley Act presents guidelines for CEOs and CFOs who are required to\ncertify the following:\n\n¢ The report does not contain untrue statements or material omissions.\n\n¢ The financial statements fairly present, in all material respects, the financial condi-\ntions and results of operations.\n\n¢ Such officers are responsible for internal controls designed to ensure that they\nreceive material information regarding the issuer and consolidated subsidiaries.\n\n¢ The internal controls have been reviewed for their effectiveness within 90 days\nprior to the report.\n\nOther SOX Regulations\n\nIn addition to Sections 404 and 302, SOX established legislation covering a variety of\nother issues. Some of these include the following:\n\n¢ Loans to Executives: Some of the most outrageous corporate looting prior to SOX\noccurred via a two-step loan process. First, boards of directors authorized huge\nloans to company officers. Second, the board sometimes conveniently autho-\nrized “forgiveness” of the loans. This process of granting outrageous company\nloans was particularly rampant in the case of WorldCom; for example, in 2001,\nthe WorldCom Compensation Committee authorized loans or loan guarantees to\nEbbers for $150 million. SOX now prohibits company loans to company officers\nand directors.\n''"

The act requires\npublic accounting firms to register with the PCAOB, and it requires the board\nto establish or modify, as required, standards for auditing, reporting, ethics, and\nquality control. It equips the PCAOB with disciplinary powers and requires the\n\nPCAOB to inspect and investigate registered accounting firms and to enforce\n\ncompliance with the established standards.\n\nThe NYSE and the NASDAQ have also strengthened corporate governance and\nfiling requirements.\n\nThe SOX Act also prohibits public accounting firms from performing specified\nnon-audit services for the firms that they audit. If a senior executive of a company\nwas previously employed by the company’s auditor and worked on the company’s\naudit, the audit firm is prohibited from auditing that company for a period of one\nyear. (It is worth noting that Enron was notorious for hiring ex-Arthur Anderson\nemployees who had worked on Enron audits.) SOX mandates auditor rotation by\nprohibiting an audit partner from being the lead or reviewing auditor of the same\ncompany for more than five consecutive years.\n\nIn an attempt to decrease the likelihood of auditors being pressured by\nmanagement into adopting manipulative accounting treatments, SOX requires\nreporting of the following to the board’s audit committee for its review:\n\n* Critical accounting policies and practices used by the organization, including\nmethods, assumptions, and judgments.\n\ne Alternative accounting treatments that were discussed with management, as\nwell as their possible effects. (This provision could prevent the situation that\narose at Enron, where Arthur Andersen’s technical oversight partner, Carl Bass,\nobjected to some of Enron’s accounting treatments and was removed from\ninvolvement with the audit at Enron’s request.)\n\n¢ Audit Committees; Audit committees consisting of a minimum of three indepen-\ndent directors are required. In addition, the SEC requires disclosure as to whether\nat least one financial expert is serving on the audit committee or the reason why\nthere is no financial expert on that committee.\n\nIndependence of Boards of Directors: SOX instituted a number of requirements\nfor boards of directors to improve their gatekeeping duties and to ensure the\nindependence of the majority of directors on company boards.\n\nIndependence of Analysts: Several of the accounting scandals discussed in this\nbook involved investment banking analysts who publicly gave certain company\nstocks “buy” ratings but left e-mail trails revealing that they believed those stocks\nwere actually poor investments. To deal with this issue, SOX added provisions\nmandating independence of analysts from their investment banking employers.\nCorporate Crime Enforcement: More generally, SOX legislation also increased\npenalties for other corporate crimes beyond the certification of false financial\nstatements.\n\nIt has been well over a decade since the implementation of SOX. While there have\nbeen sweeping changes to the financial reporting environment (and many agree that\nSOX has instigated some positive changes), others maintain that SOX may have gone\ntoo far in its attempts to clean up the U.S. business landscape.

As in the implosion of\nLehman Brothers, the fall of Bernard Madoff and other cases in recent years, many\nasked: Where were the accountants?”\n\nWhile there are those who say that the SOX reforms have not done enough to\ntransform the financial-reporting environment, others believe that SOX “has strength-\nened auditing, made the accounting industry a better steward of financial standards,\nand fended off Enron-sized book-cooking disasters” (Drawbaugh & Aubin, 2012).\n\nThe fact remains that in 2002, after the SOX Act was signed into law, the corporate\ncommunity heaved a collective sigh of relief and went back to business on Main Street.\nLittle did anyone suspect what was brewing on Wall Street.\n\nACCOUNTING FRAUD AND THE FINANCIAL CRISIS OF 2008\n\nIronically, in 1999, about two-and-a-half years before the SOX Act was signed into law,\nthe Glass-Steagall Act was repealed and the Financial Services Modernization Act was\npassed to deregulate the banking sector in the United States. This deregulation marked\nwhat many believe to be the origin of the financial crisis of 2008.\n\nPast SEC Chairman Mary L. Schapiro (2010) describes the summer of 2008\nas follows:\n\nThat July, against the backdrop of the growing subprime crisis, the federal gov-\nernment seized control of what was then the second-largest bank to fail in United\nStates history. Unemployment was only 5.5 percent, but oil prices were surging\ntowards a new high of $147 a barrel and the Dow was plunging, down 20 percent\nyear-over-year and headed much lower.\n\nEveryone knew the situation was precarious, but very few seemed to\nunderstand the seismic shift that was already underway. Merrill Lynch was still\nindependent, AIG was still solvent, and Lehman Brothers was still trading.\n\nWe were only seeing the tip of the iceberg, however. In the coming months,\nthe Reserve Primary Money Market Fund would break the buck. Wachovia and\nWaMu's banking operations would be sold off. The SEC would issue a series of\nemergency orders prohibiting short-selling of securities of financial institutions.\nAnd the financial sector would deliver the biggest bankruptcies and bailouts in\nAmerican history.\n\nAs the housing market took a nosedive and housing prices plunged, countless\nhomeowners who had toxic mortgages (mortgages that were likely to go into default)\nbegan to lose their homes, and the problem caused a domino effect. By the end of\n2008, millions of Americans were unemployed, billions of dollars in mortgages and\nmortgage-related securities had been lost, Lehman Brothers had collapsed, and the\nAmerican International Group (AIG) had to be bailed out by the federal government.\nThe SEC would later file charges “against nearly 100 individuals and entities—actions\nagainst Goldman Sachs, Citigroup, J.P. Morgan and top executives at Countrywide,\nFannie Mae and Freddie Mac” (Schapiro, 2012).\n''"

The Financial Crisis Inquiry Report (2011) explained:\n\nThe Panic fanned by a lack of transparency of the balance sheets of major finan-\ncial institutions, coupled with a tangle of interconnections among institutions\nperceived to be “too big to fail,” caused the credit markets to seize up. Trading\nground to a halt. The stock market plummeted. The economy plunged into a deep\nrecession. (p. xvi)\n\nThis widespread concern over the lack of transparency in financial statements was cer-\ntainly not unfounded. There were colossal understatements of allowances for mortgage\nloan losses, whether by fraudulent intention or by an innocent but naive belief that\nhouse prices could continue to increase forever. This underestimation of loan losses\ncorresponded with overstatements of investments in loans and mortgage-backed secu-\nrities and understatements of liabilities for repurchase of loans and for insuring inves-\ntors against defaults by mortgage borrowers. To fight the rampant fraud revealed by\nthe 2008 crisis, President Obama established the Financial Fraud Enforcement Task\n\n15\n''"

(This task force replaced the Corporate Fraud Task Force that\nwas created in 2002 in response to SOX.)\n\nJust as the response to the earlier crisis had been additional regulation (in the form\nof SOX), the 2008 crisis resulted in more regulation in the form of the Dodd-Frank Wall\nStreet Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010.\n\nTHE DODD-FRANK ACT OF 2010\n\nThe major objectives of Dodd-Frank are to “reshape the U.S. regulatory system in a\nnumber of areas including but not limited to consumer protection, trading restrictions,\ncredit ratings, regulation of financial products, corporate governance and disclosure,\nand transparency” (“The Laws ...,” 2012).\n\nDodd-Frank established the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) as\nwell as the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). The FSOC is tasked with\nthe detection of those institutions that have the power to potentially bring about\nanother financial crisis, whereas the main task of the CFPB is to safeguard consumers.\nDodd-Frank also revised and increased the responsibilities and power of the SEC.\n\nPast SEC Chairman Schapiro (2012) summarized the highlights of the SEC’s\nresponse to Dodd-Frank, as follows:\n\n¢ In the area of corporate governance, we have finalized rules concerning share-\nholder approval of executive compensation and “golden parachute” arrangements.\n\n¢ Led by the Division of Investment Management, we have adopted new rules that\nhave already resulted in approximately 1,200 hedge fund and other private fund\nadvisers registering with the SEC. It’s a process by which they agree to abide by\nSEC rules and provide critical systemic risk information that can give regulators\nbetter insight into their practices.\n\n¢ And we have established a whistleblower program that is already providing the\nagency with hundreds of higher-quality tips, helping us to avoid investigatory\ndead-ends and—at the same time—prodding companies to enhance their internal\ncompliance programs.\n\nIn another area, response to the meltdown of the mortgage-backed securities mar-\nket, the SEC has proposed rules that will protect investors by:\n\n¢ Increasing dramatically investors’ visibility into the assets underlying all types of\nasset backed securities.\n\n¢ Requiring securitizers—in conjunction with our banking colleagues—to keep skin\nin the game, giving them an incentive to double-check originators’ underwriting\npractices.\n\n¢ Changing the practices of the rating agencies whose gross mis-ratings of billions of\ndollars of mortgage-backed securities were kerosene on kindling.\n\nOf all the changes brought about by Dodd-Frank, its whistleblower program has\ngarnered a great deal of attention from the media because the whistleblowers not only\nare offered more protection than under SOX but also can now receive monetary awards\nfrom the SEC, which is pursuing whistleblower tips very seriously.\n\nThe Dodd-Frank Act made several changes to the whistleblower provisions in\nthe SOX Act in order to “clarify and improve OSHA's’ procedures for handling SOX\n''"

In October 2013, the SEC awarded over $14 million to a whistleblower:\n\nThe whistleblower, who does not wish to be identified, provided original infor-\nmation and assistance that allowed the SEC to investigate an enforcement matter\nmore quickly than otherwise would have been possible. Less than six months after\nreceiving the whistleblower’s tip, the SEC was able to bring an enforcement action\nagainst the perpetrators and secure investor funds. (“SEC Awards ...” 2013).\n\nFurthermore, in response to Title VII of Dodd-Frank, the SEC is working with the\nCommodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) to develop regulations that will sta-\nbilize and fortify our financial system in the following ways:\n\n¢ Increasing centralized clearing of swaps and ensuring that capital and margin\nrequirements reflect the true risks of these products.\n\n¢ Improving transparency to regulators and to the public by shedding light on\nopaque exposures and assisting in developing more robust price discovery\nmechanisms.\n\n¢ Increasing investor protection by enhancing security-based swap transaction dis-\nclosure, mitigating conflicts of interest, and improving our ability to police these\nmarkets. (Schapiro, 2012)\n\nSome of the important financial reporting consequences of Dodd-Frank are as follows’:\n\n¢ Smaller public companies will be exempt from Section 404(b) of the SOX Act of 2002.\n\n¢ Auditors of non-public broker-dealers will be subject to oversight by the PCAOB.\n\n¢ Changes to asset-backed securitization practices.\n\n¢ Stricter regulations for credit rating agencies.\n\n¢ Changes to executive compensation and corporate governance practices.\n\n¢ The reduction of risky investments on the balance sheets of large financial firms,\nas well as other requirements. This has come to be known as the “Volcker Rule”\n(Sarno, Mueller, & Burns, 2010).\n\nThe debate surrounding Dodd-Frank continues, with some alleging that it does\nnot do enough to stop future crises and others maintaining that it goes too far. Although\nregulation has its place in the business world, rules and laws without a sense of why\nthey matter will always be problematic because there will always be those who look for\nloopholes in order to abide by the letter of the law, rather than the spirit of the law. As\nnoted in The Financial Crisis Inquiry Report (2011):\n\nUnfortunately ... we witnessed an erosion of standards of responsibility and ethics\nthat exacerbated the financial crisis. This was not universal, but these breaches\nstretched from the ground level to the corporate suites. They resulted not only\nin significant financial consequences but also in damage to the trust of investors,\nbusinesses, and the public....

Chapter 2 of this book,\n“Ethics at Work,” examines the major ethical frameworks and how they apply to the\nbusiness world.\n\nIt is also critical that users of financial statements learn to identify the major\nmethods that companies use to manipulate financial statements, as well as the key\nsignals that indicate a company’s financial statements may have been falsified.\n\nTHE TOP-TWENTY METHODS OF FICTITIOUS FINANCIAL REPORTING\n\nThe first systematic study of the incidence of financial reporting enforcement actions\nwas the Report Pursuant to Section 704 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (or SOX Report\nof 2002). In this Report, the SEC examined enforcement actions over the period of\nJuly 31, 1997, through July 30, 2002. The Report found 227 enforcement investiga-\ntions in that five-year period, which led to the filing of “515 enforcement actions for\nfinancial reporting and disclosure violations” (p. 1). This Report classified the ficti-\ntious methods in terms of their effect on income (i.e., overstatement of revenue and\nunderstatement of expense). This categorization of the methods of fictitious financial\nreporting provides a particularly useful pedagogical progression for studying the\nmethods that companies may use to manipulate their financial statements. The orga-\nnization of Table 1.1, which follows, is based on the categories provided by the SOX\nReport (2002) and provides a list of the most prevalent methods of fictitious financial\nreporting leading to SEC enforcement actions. Table 1.1 adapts the terminology of\nthe SOX Report for each method of fictitious overstatement of income to note the cor-\nresponding overstatement of assets or understatement of debt.\n\nThere are as many methods of categorizing financial reporting violations as there\nare studies of financial reporting enforcement actions. Some studies categorize the\nfictitious reporting methods in terms of how the method manipulates income (revenue\nor expense), whereas other studies categorize the fictitious methods according to the\ncorresponding effect on misstating assets or liabilities. Either way, if one considers\nthe overstatement of assets in terms of the corresponding overstatement of revenue or\nunderstatement of expense, the most frequently used methods of fictitious financial\nreporting as described in Table 1.1 continue to occur.\n\nSince the financial crisis of 2008, however, there has been an increase in SEC enforce-\nment actions in respect of the disclosure of mortgage loans and in the understatement\nof reserves for loan losses and the corresponding overstatement of investments in loans\nand investments in mortgage-backed securities. This method of manipulating financial\nstatements has been added as a separate category in Table 1.1.\n\nChapters 3-9 of this book tell the story of real-world companies that illustrate\nthe top 20 methods of fictitious financial reporting and also identify the signals left in\nfinancial statements that alert readers to the possibility that reported income, as well as\nassets and liabilities, may have been influenced by these methods.\n\nFinally, the Appendix at the end of this book presents an overview of the top 25\nsignals indicating possible fictitious reporting in financial statements.\n''"

              "value": "24\n\nChapter 2 ¢ Ethics at Work\n\nEverything that can be counted does not necessarily count; everything\nthat counts cannot necessarily be counted.\n\n—ALBERT EINSTEIN\n\nAccording to a recent article in the Boston Business Journal, “CPAs are sexy” (Pratt, 2013).\nAnd so are forensic accountants (Blake, 2012). One of the reasons for the newfound\nappeal of accountants is the increased demand following the ratification of the\nSarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer\nProtection Act of 2010. One of the main goals of Dodd-Frank is to “promote the finan-\ncial stability of the United States by improving accountability and transparency in the\nfinancial system” (Dodd-Frank, 2010). The word ethics is used 20 times in Dodd-Frank,\nemphasizing “the reason for the Act’s creation—a compelling lack of business ethics\nas evidenced by a growing number of cases involving insider-trading, financial mis-\ndeeds and bad corporate governance in the financial services industry” (Peluso, 2012).\nHowever, a focus on external rules, regulations, and laws, without any authentic under-\nstanding of the essential nature of ethics and morality, could prove to be ineffective.\n\nA combined study by the American Institute of CPAs (in the United States) and\nthe Chartered Institute of Management Accountants (in the United Kingdom) reports\nthe following: “Four out of five businesses worldwide have committed to ethical\nperformance, but rhetoric does not always match reality.... The report found a weak-\nened ‘tone from the top’ and more pressure on financial professionals—especially\nin emerging economies—to act unethically” (“CGMA Report,” 2012). Flanagan and\nClarke point out, “Rather than relying essentially on an imposed set of external regula-\ntions, guidelines and exemplars, the professional accountant’s decisions, while reflect-\ning community expectations, will of necessity be derived from each practitioner’s\nindividual internalized decision-making processes” (2007, p. 496). In order to develop\nmeaningful and principled decision-making practices, it is necessary for accountants to\nunderstand the fundamental approaches to the philosophy of ethics. A grasp of ethics\nis also important for the establishment of what is known as an “ethical work climate”\n(Buchan, 2009).\n\nTHEORIES OF ETHICS\n\nThere are three major branches of ethics: metaethics, normative ethics, and applied ethics.\nMetaethics addresses foundational issues and presuppositions of ethical frameworks.\nIt ponders perennial questions such as what makes the good good and the bad bad?\nWhile important, this branch of ethics is beyond the scope of our discussion.\n\nBecause rightness and wrongness are in a different category from goodness and\nbadness, a separate branch of ethics, normative ethics, addresses issues of right and\nwrong actions. A normative theory makes claims or offers guidelines or norms about\nhow to discern the right action. This chapter is concerned with identifying the most\ncommon types of normative ethics.\n\nApplied ethics investigates how a normative system plays out in a practical sit-\nuation and/or within a specific field. Business ethics is a type of applied ethics, and\nthe necessity, limits, and boundaries of business ethics—specifically in relation to the\naccounting profession—are addressed throughout this text.\n''"

              "value": "Chapter 2 ¢ Ethics at Work\n\nThe Three Major Normative Ethical Theories\n\nWe can identify three major normative ethical theories, or schools of thought, accord-\ning to what is most important in the pursuit of morality—namely, consequentialism,\ndeontological theory, and virtue ethics.\n\nTo the consequentialist, the most important issue in morality is to choose the right\naction, and this choice is determined by examining the consequences of that action. On\nthe other hand, to the deontologist, the most important issue in morality is to do the\nright thing because it is right or, as often stated by the deontologist: “Do your duty for\nduty’s sake.” Under this view, if it is right to be honest, then avoiding lying and telling\nthe absolute truth is always right, irrespective of the consequences. There is a moral\nimperative to be honest no matter what the situation. Coming from a third perspective,\nthe virtue ethicist holds that the most important aspect of morality is having the right\ncharacter or set of traits, or “dispositions,” as they are often called. In a nutshell, accord-\ning to the virtue ethicist, possessing the right set of virtues is central to morality because\nwhat makes an action right is that it is the action that a virtuous person would take. In\nother words, the integrity of an action flows from the virtuous character performing\nsuch an action, and that character embodies the virtuous traits.\n\nA potential whistleblower who is deciding whether or not to reveal unethical or\nunlawful practices may use one of the three approaches. If she is a consequentialist, she\nwill determine right action by the consequences and effect on the stakeholders, such as\nthe impact it will have on her future employment, as well as the impact on employees,\nshareholders, the board of directors, managers, and consumers. If she is a deontologist,\nshe will act according to the duty she thinks is most important. If she thinks truth-telling\nis a duty, she will reveal the fraud because it is her duty to be forthcoming. Finally, if she\nfollows virtue ethics, she will use her character and virtues to guide her. She may think\nthat the virtue of courage requires her to tell the truth even in an adverse situation and\nthat the virtue of wisdom requires that she tell the truth in an astute and effective way.\n\nLet us now examine these three theories more closely and then discuss how they\napply to business ethics.\n\nCONSEQUENTIALISM While the term consequentialism refers to all approaches to the\nstudy of morality that evaluate conduct or actions in terms of the consequences that\nthey produce, it is possible to distinguish between different forms of consequentialism.\nSome schools of thought focus on actions in terms of the proportion of benefits to costs,\nwhereas others evaluate actions in terms of their benefits to the nation (nationalism) or\nbenefits to oneself only (egoism).\n\nThe leading and best-known form of consequentialism is identified as\nutilitarianism. Conceived by Jeremy Bentham (1748-1832), utilitarianism holds that the\nright action ethically is the action that maximizes the good. Bentham thought that there\nwas only one good (namely, pleasure) and one evil (namely, pain). Bentham’s protégé,\nJohn Stuart Mill (1806-1873), defined happiness as the presence of pleasure and the\nabsence of pain and believed that actions have utility when they maximize happiness.\nAccording to Mill, actions are right in proportion to the happiness they tend to promote\nand the morally best action of those open to us is the action that maximizes happiness—\nor (in his sense) has utility. Mill, who became the leading utilitarian scholar, specified\nthat the net pleasure to be maximized when performing the right action referred to the\npleasure of all who would be affected by the action, and not just one’s own pleasure.\n\n25\n''"

              "value": "26\n\nChapter 2 ¢ Ethics at Work\n\nThis type of utilitarianism is known as hedonism, encapsulated by the phrase “The\ngreatest happiness for the greatest number” (Sinnott-Armstrong, 2012). Hedonism uses\npleasure (and/or pain) to judge the consequences of an action. Right action corresponds\nwith the act that produces the greatest amount of pleasure.\n\nAs consequentialist philosophy has developed over the years, different philoso-\nphers have specified different definitions of the good, or what ought to be maximized,\nbut the unifying thread is that all consequentialists judge actions according to the\nsum of the net good that they cause among all those affected by the actions. To the\nstrict utilitarian, it is the total of the pleasure for all parties in the aggregate that deter-\nmines whether the action is right, irrespective of how that pleasure or utility or good is\nallocated among the parties involved.\n\nThe term consequentialism often refers to all the utilitarian approaches, whether\nthey refer to Mill’s strict definition of the good to be maximized or to more flexible defi-\nnitions. Philosopher Stephen Cohen (2004) succinctly described the essence of modern\nconsequentialism: “It is the effects, or consequences, that are morally significant, not\nintentions or rules or commitments.” Of all forms of moral analysis, utilitarianism is\nprobably the most widespread, and many argue that it is the most intuitive approach\nto judging what action is right and what action is wrong. Philosopher Peter Singer is a\nprominent proponent of utilitarianism. Singer explains that his form of utilitarianism\n“furthers the interests of those affected, rather than merely what increases pleasure and\nreduces pain” (1993, p.14).\n\nHowever, consequentialists are vulnerable to the argument that one cannot predict\nall the consequences that will follow in perpetuity from one’s actions. Further, even if\nwe could predict all the consequences, consequentialists are criticized on the basis that\nthe different goods are not homogeneous and there is no common denominator by which\nto measure and aggregate the benefits or harmful effects of actions to determine which\nactions to follow or which to avoid. As such, utilitarianism is capable of being either\noverly permissive or overly stringent. For instance, a utilitarian framework could theo-\nretically permit violence toward a marginal group in the name of protecting the majority.\nOr on the other hand, the same framework could also be critical of someone spending\n$4 on gourmet coffee in the United States when the $4 could save lives if given to pro-\nvide electrolytes to children in impoverished countries. As it pertains to hedonism, the\nVictorian-era philosopher Henry Sidgwick famously pointed out that when one’s objec-\ntive is pleasure, pleasure becomes elusive. This is known as the hedonist’s paradox, and it\nis an ongoing obstacle for those who try to obtain pleasure or argue for it as a moral goal.\n\nDEONTOLOGY The word deontology is derived from the Greek deon, which means\n“duty.” The deontologist does not look to the future or to the effect of actions in order to\njudge an action as right or wrong. The deontologist chooses moral action not because of\nits consequences, but because it is the right thing to do. Right actions correspond to the\nmoral law, and according to Kant, these actions are universally discernible and univer-\nsally applicable by our ability to reason.\n\nEssentially, deontologists assert that one must do the right thing because it is one’s\nduty to do so. The leading deontologist was Immanuel Kant (1724-1804). According to\nKant, if you perform an action—for example, if you tell the truth mainly because of\nthe positive consequences of telling the truth—the act does not have the same moral\nvalue as telling the truth out of your duty to always tell the truth. An action is moral\nif it is performed because it is right, not if it is performed because of its consequences.\n''"

Moreover, you must tell the truth\neven if telling the truth will cause a negative consequence. A common hypothetical\nexample of this proposition is a situation where you may know the location of a person\nwho is hiding from an ax murderer. According to Kant’s deontological view of ethics,\nif that murderer asks you if you know the whereabouts of the person in hiding, you\nare duty bound not to lie. Kant’s view holds that if you perceive telling the truth as a\nduty, then it is an unassailable duty, and telling a lie is always wrong, irrespective of the\nconsequences.\n\nKant’s standard test was that one ought to act as though a personal maxim were\na universal moral law and that law could be stipulated for everyone without it leading\nto contradiction. Kant’s concept of the categorical imperative encompasses a binding\nmoral obligation that must be universal, rational, and impartial. John Finnis presents\nKant’s three formulations of the categorical imperative:\n\n1. Act only according to that maxim by which you can at the same time will that it\nshould become a universal law.\n\n2. Act so that you treat humanity, whether in your own person or in that of another,\nalways as an end and never as a means only.\n\n3. Act according to a maxim which harmonizes with a possible realm (i.e., a\nsystematic union of different rational beings through common laws).... (gtd. in\nFinnis, 1983, p. 121)\n\nFor Kant, the moral law admitted no exception. If we have a duty, there are no\nexceptions. Further, for Kant, in order for our actions to have moral worth, we must have\nthe right motive, which is to fulfill our duty simply because it is our duty. Although no\nlist of duties has ever been specified as prescriptive, some of the more common duties\nthat Kant and his followers have suggested include the duty to develop one’s talents,\nthe duty to avoid dishonest promises, and the duty to respect the freedom of others.\n\nDeontology is often critiqued on two grounds. First, the universal impetus of\nKantian-deontology renders it incapable of adjusting for particular situations or different\nworld views, which has become an increasing concern of modern ethics. Furthermore,\nduty-based ethics may seem somewhat lacking to those who regard motivation as\na crucial factor in ethical decision making. For example, some may question spousal\nfidelity that is rooted in a general sense of duty, rather than in an authentic love that\nleads a person to stay faithful to his or her spouse.\n\nVIRTUE ETHICS As we have already noted, the three major ethical theories can be distin-\nguished by their answer to the question, “What is the most important aspect of morality?”\nAccording to Stephen Cohen, both utilitarians and deontologists look outside the indi-\nvidual (i.e., outside the decision maker) to determine the answer to that question. The\nutilitarian or consequentialist focuses on the consequences of the action to establish the\nmorality of the action, whereas the deontologist insists that morality is determined by doing\none’s duty at all times. An examination of the outer world ascertains what that duty is.\nAccording to the virtue theory of ethical behavior, the most important aspect of\nmorality is found within the individual. According to this philosophy of virtue ethics,\nhaving the right character is the most important aspect of morality. Here, as distinct\nfrom utilitarian or deontological theory, the most important issue in morality is having\nthe right set of dispositions or virtues. In other words, having a moral character is the\n\n27\n''"

Cohen (2004) describes this approach as follows:\n\nA virtue ethics view may see the process more “inside out.” Moral behavior should\nbe the result of, and flow from, a person’s character. This is not to say that moral\nbehavior is only automatic or spontaneous. It can indeed involve difficult and per-\nplexing thinking and deliberation.... Cultivation of an ethical person, then, is very\nlargely a matter of developing the right character. (pp. 49, 50)\n\nAristotle is the most famous proponent of virtue ethics. He saw the virtues as\nthose dispositions or traits that were in accord with the golden mean or the middle\ncourse. To him, extremes in behavior or tastes were vices, whereas moderation—the\ngolden mean—was the primary virtue. For example, in conversation, either constant\nchattering or complete silence would be vices, but a reasonable amount of discussion\nwould be a virtue. To Aristotle, the ultimate objective of the golden mean was the good\nor well-being of both the individual and the society, and he offered a non-exhaustive\nlist of virtues or character traits that included honesty, courage, temperance, friendship,\nand the intellectual virtues. The intellectual virtue of practical wisdom is, according to\nAristotle, a prerequisite for all the other virtues.\n\nOther virtue ethicists have suggested some different traits as conditions of being\nvirtuous. Phillipa Foot emphasized the “four cardinal virtues: courage, temperance,\nwisdom, and justice” (qtd. in Kellenberger, 1995, p. 200). Further, Foot pointed out that\nwhat is virtue in one context may not be virtue in another context. For example, cour-\nage in carrying out a random act of violence would not be considered a virtue. For vir-\ntue ethics, the driving question is “What kind of person ought I be?” The answers are\ninextricably related to one’s notion of the human telos (or ultimate purpose) and what\ndefines human flourishing.\n\nTo identify the nature of virtue, Alasdair MacIntyre sought a common thread in\nfive different views of the nature of virtue over the ages. First, he noted that during the\ntime of Homer, bodily strength and physical courage were considered major virtues\non the grounds that they enabled one to fulfill one’s social role. Second, according to\nAristotle, “the telos of man as a species ... determines what human qualities are vir-\ntues.” Traits such as temperance and practical wisdom are considered to be virtues.\nThird, Maclntyre noted the New Testament virtues of faith, hope, love, and humility that\nalso focus on the good of humanity, but here the good includes a spiritual or mystical\ngood. Fourth, Macintyre identified a “Jane Austen” view of the virtues, which included\nelements of the three approaches discussed previously and included a “real affection\nfor people” as a virtue. Finally, MacIntyre described Benjamin Franklin’s utilitarian and\nfunctional view of virtue, where hard work and early rising are seen as virtues. (Quotes\nfrom Kellenberger, 1995, p. 196)\n\nMacIntyre (2007) found coherency within these different (and sometimes seemingly\ncontradictory) views of virtue in the fact that whenever a practice is being performed,\nsuch as playing chess (or auditing!), we can perform the practice for either external\n(extrinsic) benefits or internal (intrinsic) benefits. For Maclntyre, performing a practice\nin such a way as to benefit inherently from that practice is a virtue because one achieves\nan intrinsic benefit that can be obtained only from performing the practice properly. To\nillustrate this, he used the example of playing chess. Assume that you enjoy the game of\n''"

Now assume further that you want to play chess, but there are no chess players on\nhand, and the only person available is a child who does not know the game. If you ask\nthe child to learn chess, he or she will probably refuse. If you offer the youngster candy\nas an incentive to learn the game, he or she may then agree to be taught. If you then offer\nthe child extra candy to play and some additional candy as a prize for winning, he or\nshe may be more inclined to put extra effort and concentration into the game. Now, if\nthe child were to leave the room during a game, you—who enjoy the game so much—\nwould not be inclined to cheat and move a chess piece. However, if you leave the room,\nthe youngster playing for candy would almost certainly be tempted to cheat in order to\nwin and obtain the prize. MacIntyre pointed out that the child would be playing for the\nextrinsic benefit of the prize, but you would be playing for the intrinsic benefit attached\nto the practice of playing the game as skillfully as possible. To MacIntyre, virtue can be\nfound in performing an action or a practice for its intrinsic benefits.\n\nWhile virtue ethics is able to address the utilitarian and deontological shortcomings\nof not attending to ethical agents, it is liable to be critiqued for its vague prescriptions.\nCritics ponder how one determines the virtues. Modern philosophy is skeptical of\nAristotle’s understanding of the human felos that grounds his virtues, and others worry\nthat deriving virtues for a certain group may lead to moral relativism. This is the view\nthat morality possesses no universal appeal and is not tethered to any truth claims;\nright action and the good are wholly dependent on, and relative to, the situation, actors,\nculture, group, or time period. Furthermore, how does one proceed when the virtues are\nat odds in a certain situation?\n\nIn dealing with the problem of how to teach and cultivate the virtues, virtue ethics\noften uses narratives to illustrate how a virtuous person acts.\n\nIn spite of some difficulties in the virtue-ethics model, the significance of apply-\ning virtue ethics to the business world, and to accounting in particular, is quite\nfar-reaching. Philosopher Joel Schickel (2009) explains that “because good accounting\npractice antecedently requires the formation of good moral character, professional eth-\nics in accounting presupposes that practitioners come to the profession already having\nbeen formed in certain moral virtues.”\n\nAPPLIED ETHICS: ETHICAL DECISION-MAKING MODELS\nIN THE BUSINESS WORLD\n\nHaving considered the approach of the three major normative ethical theories, we must\nnow examine how these ethical theories apply to decision making and ask, “How do we\ndecide what the right action is?” In answering this question, John E.

(qtd. in Pincus, 2002, p. 28)\n\nUnder this decision-making model, Fleming describes four approaches to Step 5\n(i.e., the ethical evaluation of the alternatives):\n\n¢ The consequentialist/ utilitarian model\n¢ The rights approach\n¢ The duties approach\n¢ The justice approach\n\nThe rights approach is often combined with the duties approach, so we will exam-\nine three distinct approaches to the ethical evaluation of alternative actions.\n\nThe Consequentialist/Utilitarian Approach to the Decision-Making Model\n\nThe consequentialist theory of ethics and morality, as previously discussed, is a par-\nticularly practical ethical decision-making approach because it stresses that the most\nimportant aspect of morality is to do the right act, and it specifies that the right act is the\none that produces the best consequences considering all the parties affected. Therefore,\nunder this approach to the decision-making model, when you are faced with an ethical\ndilemma in a business environment, it is vital to identify all of the stakeholders in the\ndecision; that is, you should consider everyone who might be affected by the decision.\nFurther, modern consequentialists agree that it is essential to consider the sum or aggre-\ngate of all the benefits and disadvantages to all of the stakeholders.\n\nUSING THE CONSEQUENTIALIST/UTILITARIAN APPROACH IN THE BUSINESS WORLD Let us\nconsider, for example, the case of an auditor who contemplates bowing to pressure\nfrom a client to give an unqualified audit opinion on a knowingly incorrect set of\nfinancial statements because the client wants to boost the company’s stock price.\nUsing this approach, the auditor should first consider all the people who could be\naffected by the decision:\n\ne Investors could suffer losses if they trade stock at prices based on the incorrect\ninformation in fraudulent financial statements.\n\ne All the employees of the company being audited are stakeholders. Many internal\n\noperating decisions of the firm are made on the basis of accounting data that is\n\nused for the financial statements. If that information is wrong, it is very likely that\n\nsuboptimal operating decisions will be made with damaging consequences for the\n\ncompany, such as lower profits and bonuses, or even bankruptcy of the company,\n\ncausing employees to lose their jobs.\n\nEmployees may choose to contribute to retirement plans that invest ina company’s\n\nstock, but they may decide on different plans if they were presented with correct\n\nfinancial statements.\n\nPotential employees may accept jobs at firms that they may not have joined had\n\nthey been in possession of correct financial statements.\n\nBanks and other lenders could make erroneous decisions based on the false infor-\n\nmation, which could have serious consequences.\n\nThe auditor could be sued or face other legal action for fraudulently issuing an\n\naudit opinion.\n''"

When\nfraudulent financial statements are allowed to be presented after corrupt audits,\nthis decreases confidence in the capital markets, which, in turn, makes it harder\nfor American firms to raise capital either locally or internationally.\n\nNow let us consider the stakeholders who potentially could suffer negative utility\nor hardship if the auditor refuses to issue a fraudulent audit opinion:\n\n¢ The auditor could be fired and lose compensation and status; he or she may suffer\nworkplace hostility from colleagues who wanted the auditor to “be more of a\nteam player” and go along with the client and the rest of the team; or the auditor\nmay keep his or her job but lose the client and the fees and possibly lose status or\npromotion in the firm.\n\n¢ The family members of the auditor are potential stakeholders because they could\nsuffer due to the auditor losing his or her job; for example, they may have to move\nto a different house or change schools.\n\n¢ The audit firm could lose an important client, which could cause other employees\nat the audit firm to lose their jobs.\n\nAccording to the consequentialist ethical decision-making model, after identifying\nall the stakeholders and estimating the potential consequences to them, the decision\nmaker (in this case, the auditor) must choose the action that he or she believes will lead\nto the maximum utility or benefit in the aggregate, taking all the stakeholders into account.\nMoreover, the mere process of identifying the possible consequences to all the stake-\nholders would likely increase the decision maker’s awareness of the wrongness of the\nunethical act, the risks associated with the wrong action, and the importance of doing\nthe right or ethical thing. If some of the executives who were found guilty in recent\nfinancial frauds had considered their own families as potential stakeholders in their\ndecisions to go along with criminal activity—on the grounds of their families’ future\nsuffering or public humiliation—it is possible that some of them may have paused long\nenough to remember the reasons society made laws against issuing fraudulent financial\nstatements in particular and against fraud in general. If some of these company officers\nhad paused to imagine their mortification as television cameras filmed their “perp”\nwalks when they were arrested for possible indictments on criminal charges, perhaps\nthey may have had second thoughts before embarking upon unethical paths of action.\n\nThe Rights-and-Duties Approach to the Decision-Making Model\n\nUnder this approach, when faced with an ethical decision, the decision maker would\nagain attempt to identify all the facts and all of the stakeholders affected by a particular\ndecision. However, here, when considering the effects of the decision on others, the\nmost important issue to consider is that of the rights of those concerned; thus, following\nthe rights-and-duties approach, the correct decision is the one that would appear to best\nserve or uphold these rights.\n\n31\n''"

              "value": "a2\n\nChapter 2 ¢ Ethics at Work\n\nIt is important to remember that ethical dilemmas frequently involve the\npossibility of actions that violate or fail to recognize the rights of others. Seen from a\nslightly different angle, the rights of those concerned usually involve a corresponding\nduty on the part of others to honor those rights. Therefore, this approach requires the\ndecision maker to fulfill his or her obligation to recognize and respect the rights of others.\nThese rights may be either legal rights or moral rights that are not necessarily protected\nby law. For instance, a company that adheres to the rights-and-duties approach may\nbelieve that workers have a right to a fair wage even if this standard is higher than the\nlegal minimum wage.\n\nIn addition to the focus on natural human rights, issues such as animal rights and\npotential cruelty to animals could also be a concern. For example, while factory farms\nare not illegal, certain beef-producing companies may believe that they have a moral\nright to provide more natural living conditions for their animals.\n\nPhilosophers classify rights in many different ways. James Sterba has identified\nfour kinds of rights:\n\n1, There are “action” rights, or the rights to do things, such as to express your opinion.\n\n2. There are “recipient rights,” which are the “rights to receive something” (e.g., the\nright to be paid for services rendered).\n\n3. There are what Sterba has called “in persona” rights, which hold against some\n“specific, nameable person or persons.” An example of an in persona right is the\nright to have a loan repaid or the right to have a promise kept.\n\n4. Sterba has also identified “in rem” rights, which hold against the world. An example\nof such a right is the right to liberty. (Quotes from Kellenberger, 1995, pp. 212, 213)\n\nUSING THE RIGHTS-AND-DUTIES APPROACH IN THE BUSINESS WORLD Using this\napproach to the ethical evaluation of alternatives in a decision-making model, a man-\nager under pressure to publish fraudulent financial statements in order to keep his or\nher job should consider all the people whose rights may be affected by this decision.\nNote that the list of those affected is virtually identical to the list in the utilitarian model,\nbut the emphasis here is not so much on the negative impact of the decision, but rather\non upholding the rights of the people involved.\n\n¢ Users of financial statements, such as stockholders, potential investors, and\npeople making loans or extending credit to the company, have the right to truthful\nfinancial statements.\n\n* Society at large relies on the capital markets, which rely on accurate information, and so\nsociety has a right to expect that public companies publish honest financial statements.\n\ne Employees of the company have a right to truthful information about the company.\n\nIt is therefore important that the auditor who is under pressure to give an unquali-\nfied audit opinion on fraudulent financial statements has a clear awareness of the\nrights of all the stakeholders. On the other hand, what about the rights of the family\nof the manager or the auditor who may be fired for resisting fraudulent financial state-\nments? What about children’s rights to be supported by their parents? How does one\nbalance these rights against the rights of the employees or other users of the finan-\ncial statements? Conversely, do the relatives of the manager or auditor have the right\nto expect not to be embarrassed by family members who are criminally charged for\n''"

              "value": "Chapter 2 © Ethics at Work\n\npresenting fraudulent financial statements? For situations when rights clash, ethicist\nJames Kellenberger (2004) makes the following two suggestions:\n\n¢ We should examine the consequences of a decision or course of action—an exten-\nsion of the utilitarian approach.\n\n¢ We should also examine the situation of conflicting rights in the context of rela-\ntionship morality—an extension of the rights and duties model. Relationship\nmorality requires that we treat all human beings with human dignity. It may be\nhelpful for us to consider the special rights and duties that our particular relation-\nships with specific persons demand.\n\nExamining this approach in the auditing context, it is important to remember that\nthe purpose of the external auditor’s assignment is to express an independent opinion of\nthe financial statements of a company for users of that company’s financial statements.\nAuditors cannot allow their relationship with the people who appoint them to interfere\nwith the special relationship they have with users of financial statements. Focusing on the\nresulting rights of financial statement users to receive a fair, independent opinion and on the\nrelationship between the auditors and all those who may use the financial statements, should\nlead auditors to better understand their duties and to better understand why they must not\naccept limits on the scope of their audits without qualifying their reports. The same goes for\nthe duty of management to produce honest financial statements in the first place.\n\nThe Justice Approach to the Decision-Making Model\n\nThe third approach presented by Fleming for analyzing ethical dilemmas in the decision-\nmaking model in order to identify the right or the moral action is the justice approach.\nOnce again, as in the other models, all the facts and all the stakeholders impacted by\nthe decision must be identified. Under this model, the matter of paramount importance\nis the fairness of treatment of all the individuals involved. Also important is the access\nto goods such as clean water and services such as health care and education. Justice,\nin the ethical sense, is focused more on distributive justice than on retributive justice—\nwhich is more the focus of legal justice. Kellenberger (1995) points out, “Distributive\njustice is concerned with fairness in the comparative treatment of persons” (p. 167). The\ngood being distributed in this context is very broad and applies to benefits generally or,\nconversely, to the general avoidance of burdens or hardships.\n\nPhilosophers differ as to the principles of distributive justice. In particular, one\nschool of thought (universalism) argues in favor of universal principles of justice, whereas\nthe communitarianism school recognizes a plurality of communities in which the diver-\nsity of the communities must be taken into account. In this case, justice will be deter-\nmined with reference to community values. At the core, both schools have the concept\nof equality in common: “Distributive justice, both universalism and communitarianism\nagree, is treating persons equally” (Kellenberger, 1995). According to Joel Feinberg (1993),\nthe principles of distributive justice are equality, need, merit, contribution, and effort.\n\nCertainly, basic human rights must be equally accorded to all people. In some\nsituations, need would be paramount in driving fair distribution, and in other situa-\ntions, one may see merit, contribution, or effort as paramount. For example, when it\ncomes to the distribution of material goods, we can all see the necessity of providing\n\n33\n''"

In the case of employment com-\npensation, many would argue in favor of extra distribution of benefits on the basis of\nmerit, contribution, or effort. However, there is little consensus among philosophers\non just how far equality in distribution extends and where merit, contribution, or effort\noverrides equal distribution in the allocation of material goods. Nevertheless, certain\naspects of distributive justice are clear enough to be useful.\n\nBoth law and morality require that factors such as race, religion, gender, sexual ori-\nentation, or national origin should not affect the distribution of benefits or burdens to\ncitizens. Further, the justice approach clearly requires us to ensure that no partiality is\nused so as to ensure that all persons falling into the same category are treated equally. For\nexample, in absence of special needs, all the students taking a particular class must ful-\nfill the same requirements. Some students cannot be required to write more essays than\nother students or take more tests or attend more class sessions. Yet all students taking one\ncourse can be required to write five essays in a semester, whereas all students taking a\ndifferent course could be required to write seven essays in the same semester, and so on.\n\nUSING THE JUSTICE DECISION-MAKING APPROACH IN THE BUSINESS WORLD In applying the\njustice approach to an ethical dilemma in the business arena, the decision maker should:\n\n¢ Identify all the stakeholders impacted by the decision,\n\ne Identify the different categories of stakeholders, and\n\n¢ Consider whether all persons in the same category are being treated in the same\nmanner—that is, that all are being treated equally and fairly.\n\nLet us consider the example of year-end bonuses being distributed in a company. In\na decision about the size of the bonuses, the justice approach requires that all employees\nof the same category (or rank) must be equally eligible for the bonus and all employees\nachieving the same target of performance must receive the same size of bonus. Examining\nthis approach in the accounting context, let us consider the case of a manager who knows\nthat the earnings in the financial statements of Company X are overstated and this man-\nager sells his or her shares to a member of the public who does not know that the earnings\nare inflated. The justice approach requires that both parties deserve equal information in\norder to make a rational decision. An auditor who knowingly fails to qualify incorrect\nfinancial statements fails to justly distribute the correct information. Under the justice\napproach, we also can better understand why insider trading is unethical: The parties\ninvolved do not have equal information. The overriding concern in the justice approach is\nthe absence of partiality and prejudice in the treatment of all persons.\n\nAN ETHICAL DECISION-MAKING MODEL FOR ACCOUNTANTS\n\nAll of the previous applied approaches to the ethical evaluation of alternatives in a\ndecision-making model address the ethical problems quite clearly and offer paradigms\nto help identify the following:\n\n¢ The facts and the alternatives\n\n¢ The stakeholders\n\n¢ The dominant ethical issues involved (such as benefits and consequences, rights\nand duties, or justice and equality)\n\n¢ The way in which the decision making may affect the stakeholders\n''"

Which ethical theory discussed\nin this chapter is most likely to take inten-\ntion into account?\nAristotle believed we are happiest when\nwe act ethically. For Aristotle, the human\ntelos is to comprehend the good, and so we\nwill be happiest when we are achieving our\ntelos. Because our ultimate end is to com-\nprehend the good, Aristotle thought we are\nhappiest when we perform right action.\nKant did not think that right action was\nnecessarily rewarded on Earth or that right\naction was accompanied by happiness in\nthis life. In fact, Kant postulated that there\nis a heaven because following the moral\nlaw does not always seem to benefit us on\nEarth. Think about your own life in light\nof these two positions. Do you think you\nare happiest when you are acting ethically,\nor do you think morality is sometimes at\nodds with your well-being? Explain your\nanswer.\n\nYour manager at Ethical Auditors is an avid\n\nKantian.

IRS-Criminal Investigation is proud to bring our financial investigative skills to\nthis complex joint investigation and be part of the team that is helping to untangle the\nweb of lies and sort out the culpabilities of the individuals involved. Today’s plea repre-\nsents an important step forward.”\n\nDOL-OIG Special Agent in Charge Robert L. Panella said, “During today’s plea,\nPeter Madoff admitted to his role in a fraud scheme that harmed the savings of thousands\nof investors. The investigation that led to today’s guilty plea by Madoff serves as a stern\nwarning to those who would knowingly undermine the financial well-being of workers.\nIn addition, by conspiring to make false statements and to falsify documents required\nby the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, he failed to protect the integrity of\nemployee benefit plan assets and personally benefited from proceeds gained as a result\nof these false statements. The OIG will continue to work tirelessly with the U.S. Attorney\nand our law enforcement partners to investigate such crimes.” DOL-EBSA New York\nRegional Director Jonathan Kay said, “Today’s plea is a testament to the good work and\nstrong collaboration among multiple federal agencies. This agency remains committed to\nprotecting worker benefit plans from those who would defraud them for personal gain.”\n\nAccording to the superseding information to which Madoff pled and other court\nfilings:\n\nMadoff was employed at BLMIS from 1965 through at least December 11, 2008.\nBeginning in 1969, he became the chief compliance officer (CCO) and senior managing\ndirector of BLMIS. In his role as CCO, Madoff created false and misleading BLMIS com-\npliance documents, as well as false reports that were filed with the U.S. Securities and\nExchange Commission (SEC) that materially misstated the nature and scope of BLMIS’s\nInvestment Advisory (IA) business.\n\nSpecifically, in his capacity as CCO, Madoff created numerous false compliance\ndocuments in which he stated that he had performed compliance reviews of the trading\nin the BLMIS IA business on a regular basis, when, in reality, the reviews were never\nperformed. The false statements were designed to mislead regulators, auditors, and\nIA clients.\n\nFurther, in August 2006, BLMIS registered as an investment adviser with the SEC.\nAs a registered investment adviser, on at least an annual basis, BLMIS was required to\nfile forms with the SEC that are used to guide the examination programs of investment\nadvisors. Madoff was integrally involved with both the SEC registration process and\nin the creation of the forms, known as “Forms ADV,” which were materially false and\nmisleading. The numerous false statements in the Forms ADV created the false appear-\nance that BLMIS’s IA business had a small number of highly sophisticated clients and\nfar fewer assets under management than was actually the case. For example, the Forms\nADV stated that there were only 23 IA accounts under management at BLMIS when,\nin fact, there were more than 4,000 at the time of the firm’s collapse in 2008 and that its\nIA services were available “only to institutional and high net worth clients.” The forms\nalso stated that, in 2008, BLMIS had $17.1 billion in assets under management when, on\npaper, it had more than $65 billion at that time. Madoff also misrepresented that he, as\nCCO, ensured that reviews of the IA trading were being performed.\n''"

Most, if not all of the “wealth,”\ncame directly or indirectly from IA client funds held at BLMIS. The schemes in which he\nengaged also allowed Bernie Madoff to evade his tax obligations. The methods by which\nMadoff engaged in tax fraud included the following:\n\n¢ Madoff received approximately $15,700,000 from Bernard L. Madoff and his wife\nand executed sham promissory notes to make it appear that the transfers were\nloans, in order to avoid paying taxes;\n\n¢ Madoff gave approximately $9,900,000 to family members, and in order to avoid\npaying taxes, executed sham promissory notes to make it appear that the transfers\nof these funds were loans;\n\n¢ Madoff did not pay taxes on approximately $7,750,000 that he received from BLMIS;\n\n¢ Madoff received approximately $16,800,000 from Bernard L. Madoff from\ntwo sham trades, and disguised the proceeds of the trades as long-term stock\ntransactions in order to take advantage of the lower tax rate for long-term\ncapital gains;\n\n¢ Madoff charged approximately $175,000 in personal expenses to a corporate\nAmerican Express card and did not report those expenses as income. Madoff also\narranged for his wife to have a “no-show” job at BLMIS from which she received\nbetween approximately $100,000 and $160,000 per year in salary, a 401(k), and other\nbenefits to which she was not entitled.\n\nIn December 2008, when the collapse of BLMIS was virtually certain, Madoff agreed with\nothers to send the $300 million that remained in the IA accounts to preferred employees,\nfamily members, and friends. BLMIS collapsed before the funds were ever disbursed. On\nDecember 10, 2008, one day prior to BLMIS’s collapse, Madoff also withdrew $200,000\nfrom BLMIS for his personal use.\n\nMadoff, 66, of Old Westbury, New York, faces a statutory maximum sentence of\n10 years in prison. The statutory maximum sentences for each of the charged offenses\nare set forth in the attached chart. Pursuant to his plea agreement with the government,\nMadoff agrees not to seek a sentence of other than 10 years in prison. Madoff is also sub-\nject to mandatory restitution and criminal forfeiture and faces criminal fines up to twice\nthe gross gain or loss derived from the offense. He has agreed to forfeiture of more than\n$143.1 billion, including all of his real and personal property. This amount represents all\nof the investor funds paid into BLMIS from 1996—the start of Madoff’s involvement in\nthe conspiracy—through December 2008.\n\nAs part of the defendant’s forfeiture, the government has entered into a settlement\nwith Madoff’s family that requires the forfeiture of all of his wife Marion’s and daughter\nShana’s assets and assets belonging to other family members. The surrendered assets\ninclude, among other things, several homes, a Ferrari, and more than $10 million in cash\nand securities. Marion Madoff is being left with approximately $771,733 to live on for\nthe rest of her life. The forfeited assets, including the net proceeds from the sale of the\nforfeited properties, will be used to compensate victims of the fraud, consistent with\napplicable Department of Justice regulations.\n\n43\n''"

However, it is also the story\nof the collision and collusion of the forces that came together when fund managers\nwho acquired Sunbeam hired a slash-and-burn chief executive officer. This is the saga\nof the analysts and journalists who watched and applauded while the auditors over-\nlooked the false profits reported by a company that had the guts ripped out of it after\nthe appointment of Albert J. “Chainsaw Al” Dunlap as CEO in 1996.\n\nWhy did Sunbeam hire a CEO with a reputation for slashing, burning, and “dumb-\nsizing” companies? Why was Al Dunlap so enthusiastic about cutting plants and jobs\nso ruthlessly? Why did Wall Street not question how production, sales, and profits\ncould possibly increase as a result of having fewer plants, fewer product lines, and\nfewer workers? Why did virtually no one take heed of demoralized and scared employ-\nees looking for safer jobs, while key executives resigned in droves? What accounting\nmechanisms were used to overstate sales and earnings? Why did none of the executives\ninform the board of directors of the unfolding chaos? What went wrong, and why did it\ngo wrong so rapidly and so relentlessly?\n\nTo answer these questions, we must look at how Sunbeam was performing in the\n1990s as compared with the stock market in general and the company’s irrational expec-\ntations. We must examine the background and personality of Al Dunlap, as well as\nWall Street’s reactions to Dunlap’s previous “turnaround” downsizings—reductions in\nthe size of a company by reducing the number of product lines, factories, offices, and/\nor personnel in a business—and “cost-cutting-at-any cost” efforts in general.\n\nSunbeam began its life in 1897 as the Chicago Flexible Shaft Company, a manu-\nfacturer of agricultural implements. With the innovation of electricity, it began pro-\nducing toasters and irons and changed its name to Sunbeam Corp. In the 1960s, it\nacquired Oster Co. and added blenders and electric blankets to the array of its then\n“high-tech” product range. However, competition for household electrical goods grew\nquickly, and in 1981, under increasing pressure, Sunbeam believed that its best option\nwas to be acquired by Allegheny International, Inc. This turned out to be a poor choice\nbecause Allegheny’s CEO, Robert Buckley, was a man somewhat ahead of his time in\nthat he was a forerunner of the high-living CEOs we are all too familiar with today.\n''"

Traveling the world in his corporate jets\nand staying in lavish corporate apartments and condominiums, he felt entitled to large\ncompany loans at very low interest rates and to a salary of over $1 million a year. It was\nnot surprising that his business focus became a little distracted. Between spectacular\nlosses and extravagant expenditures, corporate profits soon evaporated and the unfor-\ntunate Buckley was fired in 1986.\n\nThe new management team began what would be a recurring theme for\nSunbeam—team members instituted an aggressive downsizing program whereby\nthey cut one-third of the company’s jobs and sold off a number of the product lines.\nNot surprisingly, sales went down—not up. In early 1988, the company filed for\nbankruptcy.\n\nSunbeam emerged from bankruptcy under the control of Michael Price of the\nMutual Series Investment Fund and Michael Steinhardt of the Steinhardt Partners\nFund. Each had contributed around $60 million, at the urging of two dealmakers—\nPaul Kazarian and Michael Lederman—who were then appointed to manage the com-\npany, with Kazarian as CEO. They renamed the business Sunbeam-Oster. Kazarian per-\nformed a true turnaround of the company, producing genuine profits and taking the\ncompany public very successfully.\n\nAlthough Kazarian cut the extravagant waste of the Buckley era and stopped the\nwild downsizing of his predecessor’s turnaround attempt, he appeared to be a worka-\nholic and was too intense for some. He was fired and replaced with Roger Schipke, who\nwas as laid-back and gentlemanly as Kazarian had been intense. He may have overdone\nthe gentility, however, for Sunbeam at this stage had many strong personalities pulling\nin opposite directions. Without a powerful leader, profits fell quickly and steadily.\n\nAs a result of basically buying Sunbeam out of bankruptcy, Price and Steinhardt,\nthe fund managers, had an enormous amount of stock and an enormous amount of\ncontrol over Sunbeam, even after it went public. It was now 1996, and these were giddy\ntimes for Wall Street. Price prided himself on being an exceptional stock selector. He\nknew how to find bargain stocks and he felt sure that Sunbeam could be made very\nprofitable again and that its stock price could soar. He believed that he just needed to\nappoint the right kind of CEO—a leader who could do another turnaround of Sunbeam.\nHe needed a leader who had slashed costs in companies, who had cut production plants\nand products, and who had reported a profit so quickly after a period of losses that it\nwas almost too good to be true. In fact, he knew of such a man—AI] Dunlap—who had\ndone all this for Scott Paper Co. What is more, Dunlap had then sold Scott Paper to\nKimberly-Clark at a huge profit.\n\nPerhaps Price had not followed what had happened to Scott Paper after its\nreported quick turnaround profits and its rapid sale to Kimberly-Clark. Perhaps he had\nfollowed but didn’t care. Perhaps he believed that the problems had not been caused by\nthe downsizing. The trouble was that after Kimberly-Clark acquired Scott Paper, man-\nagement found it to be a mess. Scott Paper had had the guts ripped out of it. However,\nMichael Price needed a man who could slash costs and perform a company turnaround\nin no time at all, and he thought that Dunlap was just the man he needed to be the new\nCEO of Sunbeam.\n\n47\n''"

              "value": "Chapter 3 ¢ The Sizzling Saga of Sunbeam\n\nThe History of Al Dunlap\n\nAl Dunlap’s history—both his personal background and his business history of down-\nsizing businesses that later suffered—was the first warning sign that alerted analysts,\nsuch as Andrew Shore of the PaineWebber, Inc. brokerage house, to be on the lookout\nfor unsustainable profits at Sunbeam.\n\nDunlap was 59 years old when he was appointed CEO of Sunbeam in 1996.\nAlthough he claims that he was born poor and grew up even poorer, his sister said\nthat his childhood was “very comfortable.” Until he was 11 years old, he lived ina\n“three-story redbrick row house on Garden Street in Hoboken” in New Jersey. When he\nturned 11, “his family moved to Hasbrouck Heights, New Jersey, a middle-class com-\nmunity of peaceful, tree-lined streets and modest homes.” Both Dunlap’s sister and his\nhigh school football coach reported that he had always had a temper, “an aggressive\none,” according to his coach. His sister said that he “would just spin on you in a sec-\nond.” (Quotes from Byrne, 2003, pp. 97-98)\n\nDunlap’s childhood behavior sounds mild compared to his legendary temper tan-\ntrums at Sunbeam, where he would go into screaming rants that Christopher Byron\ndescribed as “extreme fighting in the boardroom,” in Testosterone Inc. Tales of CEOs Gone\nWild (2004, p. 254).\n\nDunlap worked hard at high school and got into the United States Military\nAcademy at West Point. He completed his three-year military obligation, during which\ntime he married Gwyn Donnelly when he was 24 and she was 19. Gwyn soon began\nto see another side of Al Dunlap. A few years later, in Gwyn’s divorce complaint, she\nalleged that once, while cleaning his gun collection, Dunlap had remarked, “You better\nwatch out and toe the line.” He would become enraged if she had not cleaned the apart-\nment to his satisfaction. The complaint also stated that he had once threatened to bash\nher over the head with a telephone if she did not give the telephone to him. Dunlap\nemphatically denied the divorce complaint. Ultimately, however, the judge found that\nDunlap had engaged in “extreme cruelty” and awarded Gwyn sole custody of their\nson. (Quotes from Byrne, 2003, pp. 101-104)\n\nDunlap remarried in 1968 and his new wife, Judy, was always supportive of\nChainsaw Al. She appeared to admire his aggression. It has been reported that she\nonce proudly told a party of people that Dunlap did not get heart attacks himself, but\nhe gave them to others. Al Dunlap and Judy appeared to be very well matched. They\ndid not have children, but both were dog enthusiasts and their German shepherds\nwere their pride and joy. However, Dunlap’s rage continued unabated toward the rest\nof the world. He “’was the most unpleasant, personally repulsive businessman I ever\nmet in my life’ said a New York image consultant who Dunlap had wanted to hire”\n(qtd. in Byron, 2004, pp. 18-19).\n\nDunlap’s business career echoed the same rocky pattern as his personal life. After\ngraduating from West Point and completing his three-year military obligation, Dunlap\ngot a job at Kimberly-Clark’s New Milford plant in Connecticut. In 1965, he was trans-\nferred to Kimberly-Clark’s plant in Wisconsin. The plant’s superintendent was a can-\ntankerous man who liked to chastise his employees. Not surprisingly, Dunlap got on\nwell with him and perhaps even imitated him. Dunlap was recommended for the job as\nplant manager at Sterling Pulp and Paper, also in Wisconsin. Between his military train-\ning and his angry management style, he was soon giving unpopular orders for layoffs.\n''"

              "value": "Chapter 3 © The Sizzling Saga of Sunbeam\n\nIn Dunlap’s own autobiography, he relates that soon after assuming this new position,\nhe began receiving death threats. Nevertheless, he kept that job for about six years,\nleaving only when the owner died.\n\nDunlap’s next job was at Max Phillips and Sons, where he was allegedly fired after\nless than two months for his ill manners and insolence toward his boss. Undeterred,\nhe got a job as chief operating officer at Nitec Paper Corp. in Niagara Falls, New York.\nDunlap was hired to do a turnaround at Nitec, which was in a bit of a slump. However,\nDunlap’s sojourn there lasted only about two years and ended badly as well. Nitec’s\nchairman, George Petty, fired him, declaring that “Dunlap had so completely alienated\nthose around him that Nitec faced the mass resignation of all the company’s vice presi-\ndents if he weren’t let go.” At that time, it appeared that profits had turned around posi-\ntively, and so Dunlap negotiated a $1.2 million severance package. However, just after\nDunlap left the company, “Nitec’s auditors at the accounting firm of Arthur Young & Co.\nreported that the anticipated profits that Dunlap had been promising were apparently\nthe result of massive falsifications and fraudulent accounting entries on the company’s\nbooks.” Even though there is no evidence that Dunlap had anything to do with the falsifi-\ncation, there had been no real turnaround. As a result, Nitec reneged on its promise of the\nseverance pay, and Dunlap sued and settled for $50,000. (Quotes from Byron, 2004, p. 77)\n\nFrom Nitec, Dunlap eventually found a middle-management job at American\nCan, where he rose to become head of the plastics division. From there, he moved on\nto Manville Corp., which, as a result of asbestos lawsuits, filed for bankruptcy within a\nyear after his arrival.\n\nSerendipitously, Dunlap’s next position truly seemed to be a perfect match with\nhis genetic makeup. He was recruited by Lily-Tulip, Inc., to cut costs and perform a turn-\naround of the company that was operating at a loss and had too much debt. The specific\nmandate of slashing costs was almost too good to be true for Dunlap and he tackled the\ntask with gusto. He even began to cultivate an image in the press of an executive who\ndid not shy away from cutting jobs or offending colleagues. The press ran several articles\non Dunlap in 1984, indicating that he was instilling fear into his workforce. This was the\nbeginning of what would become the long saga of an angry man who cultivated and\nwas even proud of a tough, ruthless public image that fed his apparently already ruth-\nless streak. He interpreted “mean” as “strong,” and he titled his memoir Mean Business:\nHow I Save Bad Companies and Make Good Companies Great. Dunlap took his cue from\nthe media: Nothing captured the business press’s attention more than a slash-and-burn\ndownsizing. And the more jobs he cut, the tougher and smarter the press made him\nlook. By the end of his time at Lily-Tulip, Dunlap had cemented his public image as a\nruthless downsizing and turnaround specialist—and he was proud of it.\n\nAfter Lily-Tulip, Dunlap went on to work in Britain and then in Australia for Kerry\nPacker’s Consolidated Press Holdings. He left Consolidated Press embroiled in conflict\nwith a number of colleagues, as described in an article titled “Al Dunlap’s Disgrace”\n(Williams, 2001). However, the controversy in Australia did not seem to count against\nhim at all when he went after the job of CEO of Scott Paper, which was also badly in\nneed of a turnaround.\n\nBy the last quarter of 1993, Scott Paper was sustaining large losses and its CEO,\nPhilip Lippincott, wanted out. There were not many seasoned executives who wanted\nhis job. Lippincott had already publicized a downsizing plan that would require lay-\ning off more than 8,000 employees over a number of years.

Al Dunlap arrived to take the helm of Scott Paper in\nApril 1994 and he slashed more than 11,000 jobs in less than one year. He sold off large\npublishing and printing businesses as well as the company’s domestic timberlands and\na number of overseas paper mills. It is difficult to second-guess which of these should\nhave stayed and which should have gone, if any. However, when research and devel-\nopment expenditure is deeply cut and maintenance on property, plant, and equipment\nis deferred, it is usually a fairly good guess that management is focused on short-term\nearnings instead of long-term growth and profit. It is easy to get profits up in the cur-\nrent year by cutting R&D, but that will kill future growth and profits.\n\nIn an interview with an executive from Scott Paper, John Byrne was told that\n“by the end of 1994, it just became a volume-driven plan to pretty up the place for\nsale.... We’re talking about a whole new definition of short-term.” In addition, “Dunlap\nslashed the company’s research and development budget in half, to about $35 million,\nand eliminated 60% of the staffers in R&D.” Dunlap also cut back on memberships in\nindustry organizations and “eliminated all corporate gifts to charities.” (Quotes from\nByrne, 2003, p. 27)\n\nIn a precursor to what would happen at Sunbeam, big sales discounts were given\nto accelerate sales, and “in the final months before the company was sold, the dis-\ncounts were doubled.” The stock price went up dramatically based on reported profits.\nDunlap managed to sell Scott Paper to Kimberly-Clark in July 1995 and he left Scott\nPaper $100 million the richer. Not surprisingly, Kimberly-Clark soon realized that Scott\nPaper, in fact, had had the guts ripped out of it. Predictably, with the highly discounted\nsales before Scott was sold, its sales were slow in the next period. With plants closed,\nbusinesses cut, and workers retrenched, combined with little R&D and sparse main-\ntenance, growth did not increase; inevitably, it fell. Kimberly-Clark took a $1.4 billion\nrestructuring charge in respect of its integration of Scott Paper. Al Dunlap did not seem\nto care; he was out of Scott’s as a very rich man—and a lucky one. Kimberly-Clark was\nleft with the mess. Chainsaw Al, however, was not ready to retire. He was looking for a\nnew company to “turn around.” (Quotes from Byrne, 2003, pp. 28-32)\n\nHow Wall Street Embraced Sunbeam’s Downsizing Plans\n\nWhen Dunlap went looking for a new job after selling off Scott Paper, the general atti-\ntude toward downsizing at the time was that it was effective and that Dunlap had the\nworld’s leading reputation for downsizing. In 1996, Sunbeam was sustaining losses.\nThe board was looking for a replacement for its CEO, Roger Schipke, who was consid-\nered too placid to provide the assertive leadership that the troubled company needed.\nDunlap was the man for the job. On July 18, 1996, Albert J. Dunlap was appointed CEO\nof Sunbeam, Inc.\n\nAlthough it was becoming obvious that Dunlap’s cost-cutting turnarounds were\nnot turning out to be such positive transformations after all, the business press gener-\nally ignored the short-lived nature of the profits that followed his ruthless downsizings.\nIn the 1990s, Wall Street was happy to read optimistic news into almost any confidently\nannounced plan. The more dramatically a plan predicted a spectacularly profitable\nvision of the future, the more the press and the analysts loved it. This was a time when\ncompanies were going public with no records of profits—sometimes not even of sales—\nand a time when a simple click on a website was enough to be counted as a customer.\n''"

After all, he\nwas a brilliant businessman with a simple strategy—he was going to slash costs. And\nhow was he going to slash costs? He was going to close production plants, drop prod-\nuct lines, and slash workers’ jobs. That was Dunlap’s vision for Sunbeam. If the CEO\nof acompany that was sustaining losses suddenly and miraculously reported a profit\nin the financial statements without dramatically announcing a restructuring plan—\na major plan to reorganize the company in the form of downsizing or changing the\ncompany’s capital structure or reorganizing the company’s debt agreements—this\nwould be a little suspicious. One might wonder whether the financial statements\nhad been fraudulently reported, or at least one might question whether they had\nbeen erroneously reported. Similarly, if management announced that it was going\nto increase sales by cutting products and increase production by closing plants and\nfiring employees, that would sound counterintuitive; the logic might be questioned,\nand the predictions of increased earnings might not sound credible. However, if the\nCEO announced that he or she was going to perform a turnaround in a brief period\nby embarking on an aggressive downsizing and cost-cutting plan, Wall Street would\nembrace the plan and celebrate the vision of a quick turnaround with high profits and\neven higher stock prices.\n\nThe fact of the matter is that profits are maximized when total revenues exceed total\ncosts by the greatest amount, which is not achieved by just cutting production facilities\nand employees or cutting R&D and marketing costs. Cutting is likely to reduce revenues\nmore than it reduces costs and that will lead to less profit. If the object is just to cut costs,\nyou can cut costs all the way to zero by liquidating the company. That will not maximize\nprofits; it will produce a profit of zero. So cost-cutting is not an end in itself. It must be\ndone scientifically, taking care to cut only costs that do not support greater revenues.\nAnalysis, discernment, and precision are vital. The unintended consequences of cutting\ncosts to increase short-term profits can easily cause long-term losses.\n\n“Downsizing or Dumbsizing?”\n\nAn article in BYU Magazine titled “Downsizing or Dumbsizing?” succinctly cap-\ntured the perils of these unintended consequences. It told the story of how, in 1994,\nProfessors Lee Tom Perry and Eric L. Denna presented a cost-cutting plan to the\nexecutive committee of Scott Paper Co. The plan was well received, but before any\nimplementation, Perry and Denna’s consultancy was ended when Al Dunlap took\nover as CEO of Scott Paper. Professor Perry later remarked, “Obviously, something\nneeded to be done. But what bothers me about Al Dunlap is his lack of precision. He\nhas a very simplistic view: smaller is better” (qtd. in Jenkins, 1997).\n\nSunbeam apparently did not realize that there is a crucial difference between a\ndownsizing and a dumbsizing. Clearly, companies must respond to changes and initi-\nate changes. The economist, Val Lambson, observed:\n\nThe way capitalism works is that it sends signals through prices telling people\nwhat they ought to be doing based on what’s valued by consumers. The advan-\ntage of a free-market system is that it allocates the resources in a productive and\nefficient way. The results are beneficial for the whole. (Qtd. in Jenkins, 1997)\n\n51\n''"

Cameron, explained\nthat downsizing must be an improvement process, not a target: “If they merely cut posi-\ntions and headcount, but do not address the fundamental problems causing inefficiency\nand lack of competitiveness, the problems are still going to be there even after down-\nsizing.” Cameron acknowledged that while downsizing is sometimes necessary, when\nit is done badly, it is a most unproductive and futile method of trying to improve a\ncompany. Cameron likened it to a “grenade strategy,” explaining that when you fling\n“a grenade into a company ... it explodes, eliminating the positions of a certain num-\nber of people. The problem is you have no way of telling precisely who is going to be\naffected.” (Qtd. in Jenkins, 1997)\n\nCameron pointed out:\n\nIn the end, a corporation almost always loses company memory and company\nenergy. The first is caused when informal networks are destroyed, information\nsharing is restricted, and experienced employees depart. The second is caused by\ndeclining morale, loss of loyalty and commitment, and the departure of the most\ntalented employees, who know that they are marketable. (Qtd. in Jenkins, 1997)\n\nOf course, cutting R&D and maintenance expenditures is going to hurt you in\nthe future. At the same time, as Lambson pointed out, “When there’s a technological\nchange, or a change in consumer tastes, the changes are reflected in the prices. That’s a\nsignal to industry producers—the black-and-white television industry, for example—\nto retrain, retool, and move into other areas, which may cause some downsizing.” As\nPerry explained: “Increased resource utilization is good for both business and society.\nThat doesn’t mean downsizing is out of the picture, but the Al Dunlaps would be.”\n(Qtd. in Jenkins, 1997)\n\nCost-accounting analysis shows that when a company closes down a segment,\nalthough it does lose that segment’s revenues, it does not lose all of the costs that\nare allocated to it in typical income statements. Some of those costs—the common or\nallocated fixed costs that support more than one segment of the business and will not\ndecrease if any one segment is eliminated—will remain and will simply have to be car-\nried by the remaining divisions. Only the costs that are truly caused by the division\ncontinuing—the traceable fixed costs and the variable costs—will be saved if the divi-\nsion is closed. Frequently, segments are closed without this analysis being done, and the\nresult is often that the company is surprised to find that it has less profit, not more, after\nthe segment is closed.\n\nDunlap’s Carrot-and-Stick Approach\n\nDunlap structured control over his management team at Sunbeam with one of the most\nsevere carrot-and-stick combinations ever implemented in U.S. business. The carrot was\nthat executives and managers were allocated large numbers of stock options that would\nmake them multimillionaires if the Sunbeam stock price went up dramatically. This\nwas a large carrot that caused many executives, even those who despised Dunlap from\npast experience, to join him again for the Sunbeam turnaround. It also encouraged a\nnumber of managers who were working for Dunlap for the first time at Sunbeam to stay\nput because another key part of the carrot-and-stick deal was that the options Dunlap\ndoled out vested after only three years. Many executives spent their entire tenure under\n''"

              "value": "Chapter 3 ¢ The Sizzling Saga of Sunbeam\n\nDunlap caught in a dilemma: They desperately wanted to leave, but they would be\nwalking away from potentially millions of dollars of stock-option gains, as long as the\nprice of Sunbeam shares stayed up or went higher. The stick ingredient in Dunlap’s\ncarrot-and-stick approach was the raw fear he instilled in everybody who worked for\nhim. All reports are that this really did apply to everyone.\n\nThe installation of fear began on Al Dunlap’s very first day on the job at\nSunbeam. All the top executives assembled for a meeting in the boardroom of the\nFort Lauderdale, Florida office. Dunlap walked into the meeting and began a “mono-\nlogue on himself and the company.” He then turned to the gathering of company offi-\ncers and began ranting and raving, admonishing them for the “demise of Sunbeam!”\nHe kept repeating that the “old Sunbeam is over today. It’s over.” In his description\nof the scene, Byrne wrote: “Glaring fiercely, Dunlap kept repeating the phrase, again\nand again, saliva spitting from his lips. His chest was puffed out and his face flushed\nbright red. The men stared in silence, incredulous at this outrageous performance.”\n(Quotes from Byrne, 2003, pp. 2-3)\n\nDunlap then confronted the CFO, Paul O’Hara, and blamed him for Sunbeam’s\nfailure to meet the previous year’s financial performance estimates. Next, Dunlap\nbegan asking the executives to present their summaries of the state of their units or\ndepartments. He started with the unfortunate James Clegg, the chief operating officer,\nwho had expected to get Dunlap’s job. Dunlap “cut him off and accused him of not\nknowing the details of his businesses.” Dunlap snapped at anybody who hesitated.\nRichard Boynton, Sunbeam’s national sales manager, later said, “He [Dunlap] just\nyelled, ranted and raved.” Dunlap kept this up for the entire first day. On the second\nday, Dunlap called Clegg out of the meeting and told him to leave the company and\nimmediately sign the release form that honored his contract, including his salary for\na year and his vested options. “Less than fifteen minutes after leaving the boardroom\n[Clegg] returned to pick up his briefcase. ‘I’m out,’ he said to his shocked colleagues.”\n(Quotes from Byrne, 2003, pp. 5-8)\n\nOver the next few days, Dunlap fired five more executives. The fear factor was\nfirmly in place. The big stick was looming over every senior executive and manager.\nThe carrot in the form of extremely generous options beckoned to the remaining execu-\ntives with the promise of great riches.\n\nTo grasp the unpleasant yet enticing position that the Sunbeam management\nteam found itself in, one must remember that the year was 1996. Stock prices were\nrising boisterously; restructuring and downsizings were in vogue among Wall Street\nanalysts and journalists; and the king of downsizing and restructuring, Al Dunlap\nhimself, was promising to turn Sunbeam around in twelve months, maybe even less.\nOn July 19, the day after the announcement of Dunlap’s appointment as CEO, Wall\nStreet analysts gave buy ratings to the stock and its market price jumped from $12.50\nto $18.63.\n\nBy early November, the stock was trading around $25 per share. Considering how\nfast the stock market as a whole was climbing in 1996, Sunbeam’s stock had moved\nupward relatively modestly after the initial jump on the announcement of Dunlap’s\nappointment. To propel the stock price much higher, he wanted to produce a spectacu-\nlar slash-and-burn downsizing plan for Wall Street. To get a truly dramatic, aggressive\ncost-cutting plan together, Dunlap turned to a long-trusted consultant at Coopers &\nLybrand to head the project.\n\n53\n''"

              "value": "54\n\nChapter 3 ¢ The Sizzling Saga of Sunbeam\n\nDunlap announced his stunning cost-cutting plan on a conference call with ana-\nlysts on November 12, 1996. The next day, the Wall Street Journal ran an article dramati-\ncally titled, “Dunlap’s Ax Falls—6,000 times—at Sunbeam.” In the article, Frank and\nLublin (1996) gave details of the plan announced by Dunlap:\n\n¢ Immediately get rid of half of Sunbeam’s 12,000 employees.\n¢ Shut down about 40 of its 61 warehouses.\n\n¢ Cut loose almost 90 percent of its product line.\n\n¢ Get rid of more than half of its 26 factories.\n\ne Eliminate the majority of its offices.\n\nThe article went on to say that “Albert Dunlap all but gutted Sunbeam Corp.\nand demonstrated once again the genesis of his nickname: ‘Chain-Saw Al.’” Dunlap’s\nplan estimated “a one-time pretax charge of $300 million, of which $75 million will\nbe paid as severance costs associated with plant closings.” Furthermore, the reduction\nof 6,000 people “appears to represent one of the single biggest percentage cutbacks\never announced by a major US corporation.” The downsizing expert and author, Alan\nDowns, commented, “You don’t cut that dramatically without creating chaos inside the\ncompany.” (Qtd. in Frank & Lublin, 1996)\n\nSurprisingly, for the first time Wall Street was not impressed with a Dunlap\nslash-and-burn announcement. The stock price did not rise. Perhaps the plan was so stun-\nning that it gave cause for concern that Sunbeam was in worse shape than anyone had\nrealized. Perhaps Kimberly-Clark’s troubles with Scott Paper, after Dunlap’s alleged turn-\naround, had left Wall Street a little wary of Dunlap’s cost-cutting strategies. Maybe word\nhad leaked that some managers were in shock about what they considered to be economic\nsuicide: the closing of plants that they regarded as efficient low-cost/high-profit facilities.\nWhatever the reason, Wall Street did not respond to this ruthless announcement. In fact,\nSunbeam’s stock price actually dropped 50 cents on the day of the announcement.\n\nNo wonder the stock market was a little skeptical. How could closing so many\nfactories lead to increased production and sales? How could fewer people produce and\nsell more? However, whether by design or by coincidence, the dramatic announce-\nments of cost cutting had laid the foundation for lending credibility to the suddenly\nincreasing false profits that would be reported in the near future. If Sunbeam had begun\nfalsely reporting overstated sales and profits in 1997, without any dramatic plan at all,\nthe numbers in the financial statements probably would have been questioned much\nsooner. All Sunbeam had to do after this dramatic slash-and-burn action was report\nsales and profit growth and all would be believed. Accompanied by reported increases\nin profits, the plant and warehouse closings didn’t have to be logical—they just had to\nbe dramatic—and they were.\n\nTwo plant closings stood out as particularly ill conceived. Byrne reported conver-\nsations with employees and managers at the McMinnville, Tennessee plant indicating\nthat this was one of the most profitable plants at Sunbeam. It produced 15,000 hair clip-\npers and trimmers a day and its sales were growing. Further, the quality of its products\nwas very high and its profit margins were much higher than Sunbeam’s margins on\nits blenders or blankets. Sunbeam also had a very low lease cost at McMinnville, only\n“pennies per foot in rent, some $29,000 a year” (Byrne, 2003, p. 131). However, there\nwere plans to move the plant to Mexico to save on labor costs, even though transport\ncosts would be higher and moving the factory would cost millions of dollars. The plant\n''"

Nevertheless, a line of clippers was\nmoved out of McMinnville and large numbers of sales were lost because of unantici-\npated production shortages caused by the restructuring plan.\n\nIn the small town of Bay Springs, Mississippi, Dunlap’s decision to close the plant\nthat made the high-quality wire for Sunbeam’s electric blankets was possibly his most\neconomically unfeasible. The city had given Sunbeam the rent-free use of the building\nfor the plant. To keep jobs in the town, the mayor went on a public campaign to point\nout the economic stupidity of moving the plant. It was going to cost millions of dollars\nto relocate the plant in an absurd attempt to save a few hundred thousand dollars of\ntransportation costs a year. As much as the mayor made sense, Dunlap resented the\nopposition and the plant was closed.\n\nThe numerous problems of trying to run Sunbeam after it was gutted by the restruc-\nturing plan were documented in a Wall Street Journal article by Lublin and Suris (1997).\nThere were bar-coding problems with shipping to its biggest customer, Wal-Mart, as\nwell as a failed delivery of 150,000 irons, among other items. There were also problems\nwith the invoicing system and the computer system. In fact, Wal-Mart considered end-\ning its relationship with Sunbeam due to these glitches. Other large customers claimed\nthat shipments were late and that the staff turnover made continuity difficult.\n\nHaving pushed ahead with cutting jobs and closing plants, Dunlap began to\napply his trademark brand of motivation—the fear and the dreams of stock option\nriches—to put the pressure on management. With gutted production facilities and a\ndemoralized workforce, Dunlap began to pressure his management team to agree to\nincredibly high target estimates for sales and production.\n\nThe pressure to meet the sales figures fell first to the head of the sales department,\nwho had to pass it down the line, and the same applied to the head of the production\ndepartment. Managers simply couldn’t achieve the unrealistic numbers, but they felt\nthere would be repercussions if they didn’t agree to them. And they didn’t want to\nlose their stock options, which had increased in value, but for the most part had not\nyet vested. They were in a bind. A number of employees left. Those who remained and\naccepted their unfeasible target numbers had to find ways to meet them.\n\nOne of the things that had swayed some of the mangers in their decision to work\nfor Dunlap in spite of their aversion to him was that he had told them that his plan for\nSunbeam was to make a very quick turnaround and then to find an outright buyer for\nthe company, as he had done with Scott Paper. If that could be done in a year, many of\nthe managers thought it would be worthwhile to stick around and wait for their stock\noptions to turn into huge financial windfalls. With such an incentive, they believed they\ncould stomach anything for a year. However, the combination of what amounted to the\ngutting of the company with the restructuring plan, together with Wall Street’s luke-\nwarm reaction to it, caused some of the management to become skeptical. This was\ncertainly the case with Newt White, executive vice president for consumer products. A\nfew days after Sunbeam’s downsizing announcement and Wall Street’s cool response,\nWhite realized that this was not going to be a quick turnaround and there was not going\nto be a company gullible enough to acquire Sunbeam and rescue the current manage-\nment team from Sunbeam’s mess. So less than a week after Dunlap announced his plan,\nWhite left Sunbeam.\n\n55\n''"

              "value": "56\n\nChapter 3 ¢ The Sizzling Saga of Sunbeam\n\nMany believe that Sunbeam never recovered from the blow of losing White. When\nSunbeam lost White, it lost an extremely talented and capable manager and a crucial\namount of “company energy” (qtd. in Jenkins, 1997). His departure represented the loss\nof “informal networks” and “information sharing,” of which Cameron spoke (gtd. in\nJenkins, 1997). White’s leaving represented one of the unintentional consequences of\nindiscriminate downsizing: Due to “declining morale,” the most talented employees\nleave. According to White’s friends, he “despised Dunlap” (Byrne, 2003, p. 68). White\ncould not tolerate the thought of a long stay in the environment that Dunlap was creating.\n\nAN OVERVIEW OF SUNBEAW’S FICTITIOUS FINANCIAL\nREPORTING SCHEMES\n\nSunbeam engaged in two major schemes to make its financial statements appear much\nhealthier than they really were: improper timing of revenue recognition (the process\nof formally recording a revenue item in the financial statements in an earlier or later\nperiod than the period in which the item should have been recorded) and improper use\nof restructuring reserves. .\n\nLet’s examine Sunbeam’s ploys.\n\nScheme #1: Improper Timing of Revenue Recognition via Bill and Hold\nSales, Consignment Sales, and other Contingent Sales\n\nUnder intense pressure to make the sales and profit targets, Sunbeam recorded future\nperiods’ sales in current periods. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)\nfindings explained how, for almost two years, Sunbeam’s senior management deliber-\nately embarked on a series of deceptive activities to increase the perceived value of the\ncompany (AAER 1393).\n\nThe following is a summary of the alleged tactics that Sunbeam used, beginning\nwith the first quarter of 1997 until the second quarter of 1998, to accelerate future quar-\nters’ sales in order to boost current periods’ profits and give a misleading impression of\nsales growth:\n\n1. Beginning in the first quarter of 1997, Sunbeam offered deep discounts and\nextended payment terms to get customers to place the next period’s orders early.\nThis acceleration of future quarters’ sales into the present quarter “provided a\nmisleading impression of the Company’s results of operations for the present\nperiod.” A worse consequence, of course, was that it “also resulted in the erosion\nof the company’s profit margins and impoverished sales in later periods.” In a\nnutshell, this began a death spiral because the ploy would have to be repeated in\nthe future in order for the company to announce success in meeting target sales.\nFurther, the SEC reported that Sunbeam “failed to disclose this practice in its\nquarterly filing on Form 10-Q, as required under Regulation S-IC, Items 101 and\n103.” (Quotes from AAER 1393, 2001)\n\n2. Beginning in the first quarter of 1997, Sunbeam recorded contingent sales or guar-\nanteed sales as normal current-period sales. These were sales to customers where\n\n \n\n* Sunbeam consented to the entry of the order without admitting or denying the findings or conclusions of\nlaw as set out in AAER 1393, May 15, 2001.\n''"

Some of these customers did\n\nreturn the goods to Sunbeam in later quarters. Such non-GAAP sales increased\n\nSunbeam’s reported earnings; however, “GAAP does not permit the recognition\n\nof revenue in transactions lacking economic substance” (Cullinan & Wright, 2003,\n\np. 192). Revenue recognition refers to the process of recording a transaction in the\n\nfinancial statements, indicating that the conditions have been met for the earning\n\nof revenue. Generally, revenues refer to sales, the rendering of services, or other\noperating activities that result in an increase in assets or a decrease in liabilities.\nAccording to the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Statement of\n\nFinancial Accounting Concepts No. 5, two conditions must be satisfied before enti-\n\nties can recognize revenue:\n\ni. The revenue must be realized or realizable.\n\nii. The revenue must be earned.\n\nCurrent GAAP has many industry-specific and transaction-specific rules for rev-\n\nenue recognition. The FASB is working closely with the International Accounting\n\nStandards Board (IASB) to issue a new principles-based converged revenue recog-\n\nnition statement. The FASB tentatively requires that the new standard will be effec-\n\ntive “for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016,” for public\n\ncompanies (Revenue Recognition Project, 2013, p. 15).\n\n. Beginning the second quarter of 1997, Sunbeam became more aggressive and des-\n\nperate and began using bill and hold sales, in which the customer is billed and\n\na sale is recorded when the order is placed but the goods are held for delivery\n\nuntil a later date to entice customers to place future periods’ sales orders early.\n\nSunbeam again offered discounts and extended payment terms and sometimes\n\neven provided the right to return the goods to Sunbeam if they could not be sold.\n\nHowever, because the orders were so far in the future, the customers did not want\n\nto hold the goods in their inventory ahead of time; so Sunbeam agreed to hold the\n\ngoods that it had “sold” in the current period until the customers really needed\nthem in the next period. There are a number of criteria that must be met before bill\nand hold sales are allowed to be recorded in a current period’s sales and earnings:\n\na. The buyer, not the seller, must request that the transaction be on a bill and hold\nbasis.\n\nb. The buyer must have a substantial business purpose for ordering the goods on\na bill and hold basis.\n\nc. The risks of ownership must have passed to the buyer. To ascertain when\nthe risks of ownership are passed to the buyer, one should refer to the terms\nof the deal to see whether the sales contract specifies FOB shipping, where\nownership passes to the customer when the goods are handed over to the\nshipper, or FOB destination, where ownership passes when the goods\narrive at their final destination.\n\nOther relevant factors include “whether [the seller] has modified its normal bill-\n\ning and credit terms for this buyer” and “the seller’s past experiences with and\n\npattern of bill and hold transactions” (AAER 1393, 2001).\n\nSunbeam, nevertheless, recorded these sales as current-period sales even\nthough they did not meet the criteria.\n\n57\n''"

To coax even more sales orders, Sunbeam increasingly gave customers the right to\n\nreturn goods, yet did not increase the reserve for returns in its accounting records.\nThis overstated reported income. In addition, the SEC’s findings alleged that in\nJanuary 1998, the CFO, Russell Kersh, “ordered the deletion of all return authoriza-\ntions from the company’s computer system ... [and] deleting the authorization file\ndelayed acceptance of some quantity of pending returns long enough so that they\ndid not count against net sales for the first quarter” (AAER 1393, 2001). Further,\nwhile sales with rights of return were growing, at year end 1997, Sunbeam actu-\nally reduced its reserve for returns from $6.5 million to $2.5 million.\n\n. In the first quarter of 1997, Sunbeam sold products that it planned to discontinue\n\nas part of its restructuring plan. Sunbeam knew that sales of these items would\nnot be continued because the product lines had been dropped. Also, they were\nsold at huge discounts to dispose of the products fully. These sales should have\nbeen reported separately from continuing sales as an infrequent event, but they\nwere recorded as regular ongoing sales. (This gave a misleading impression of\nSunbeam’s sales “growth” and its future profitability.) The SEC findings showed\nthat such sales totaled $19.6 million in the first quarter of 1997 (AAER 1393, 2001).\n\n. Also, pursuant to product lines that were to be closed as part of the restructuring\n\nin 1996, Sunbeam overstated the amount by which the inventory had to be writ-\nten down for all the segments that were going to be closed. This was part of its\ncreation of cookie-jar reserves—reserves created by overstating a future liability\nin one period in order to release it in a future period, thereby implying that the\ncompany has less expense in the future period. Then beginning in the first quarter\nof 1997, profits were overstated as these inventories were sold at amounts above\nthe amount recorded in 1996. In the first quarter of 1997, quarterly income was\ninflated “by approximately $2.1 million” (AAER 1393, 2001).\n\n. In the fourth quarter of 1997, Sunbeam entered into a thoroughly inconclusive\n\n“sales” agreement with a fulfillment house to sell an indeterminate amount\nof spare parts to the customer. The contract stated that it “would terminate in\nJanuary 1998, absent agreement between the parties on the value of the inven-\ntory.” Sunbeam even guaranteed a profit of 5 percent to the “customer” on any\nfuture resale of this inventory. Despite the conditional and indeterminate nature\nof this agreement, Sunbeam recorded $11 million sales and $5 million profit on\nthe “sale” in 1997, even though, as the SEC stated, “The sale price had no practical\nrelationship to any payment Sunbeam might obtain.” Upon the auditor’s unwill-\ningness to classify such an agreement as a sale, Sunbeam agreed to create a reserve\nof $3 million against the profit it had raised, but left the balance of the income in\nthe 1997 financial statements. (Quotes from AAER 1393, 2001)\n\n. Sunbeam recorded rebates on future purchases as deductions from the current\n\nperiod’s cost of goods sold expense. In 1997, the company aggressively negotiated\nwith suppliers to secure rebates that applied to purchase contracts covering future\nperiods’ purchases. One rebate contract included an up-front payment in respect\nof future purchases. Naturally, according to GAAP, rebates should decrease the\ncost of goods sold expense in the period that the goods are sold. Instead of pro-\nrating them, Sunbeam applied these rebates to decrease cost of goods sold in\nthe period that it signed the rebate contracts. The Commission found that “the\nsuppliers’ rebates obtained by Sunbeam beginning in the second quarter of 1997\n''"

Sunbeam captured extra revenue by extending its quarter-end date by two days.\nIn the first quarter of 1998, in order to include the results of its newly acquired\ncompany, Coleman. Sunbeam changed its quarter end from March 29 to March 31.\nThis is legal. However, in its press release on April 3, Sunbeam made no mention\nof the fact that the shortfall in sales for the quarter was after adding two days’ sales to\nthe quarter. Sunbeam did, however, disclose the change in its 8-K filing on April 13,\n1998, and in the 10-Q that it filed on May 15, 1998.\n\n10. Sunbeam was also accused of issuing misleading press releases, as well as con-\nducting ambiguous and deceptive press conferences and conference calls with\nanalysts. Sunbeam categorically denied its “channel stuffing’”—persuading cus-\ntomers to place a later period’s orders in the current period. Essentially, the seller\n“stuffs” more inventory into the customer’s warehouse than the customer cur-\nrently needs. For example, using big discounts and extended payment terms, the\nseller entices the customer to order goods ahead of time. Sunbeam also blatantly\noverstated its sales and earnings estimates and deliberately failed to disclose any\nof the previously mentioned nine manipulations that it had used to present a mis-\nleading impression of its sales and profit growth. In the press release announc-\ning its results for the first quarter of 1997, Sunbeam’s sales showed growth of\n10 percent compared to the first quarter of 1996. However, in publicizing its\nresults, Sunbeam did not disclose that much of that growth came from the sales\nof discontinued products and from the guaranteed sales, as explained earlier in\npoint 2. Furthermore, the SEC declared, “As members of Sunbeam’s management\nknew or were reckless in not knowing, these misstatements and omissions ren-\ndered Sunbeam’s press release materially false and misleading.” The SEC also\nfound that although Sunbeam had ostensibly met its earnings targets for the third\nquarter of 1997 by relying on accelerating future periods’ sales, “management\npublicly denied the contention of certain analysts that Sunbeam relied on channel\nstuffing to achieve its revenue targets.” (Quotes from AAER 1393, 2001)\n\nWhen it came to the fourth quarter of 1997, all the tricks (as previously described—\nand more) were still not enough to meet Sunbeam’s unlikely targets. Dunlap then blamed\nthe warm weather for its effect on sales of electric blankets. However, “What investors\ndidn’t know would have caused Sunbeam stock to suffer a total collapse” (Byrne, 2003,\npp. 169-170). Although just short of Sunbeam’s own unrealistic targets, the reported results\nafter all the ploys to accelerate future sales were supposedly record results. In its press\nrelease on January 28, 1998, Sunbeam maintained that the increase in its sales was a “clear\nindication that [Sunbeam’s] strategy is working.” The SEC subsequently concluded that\n“this press release and the associated conference call between Sunbeam and its analysts\ncommunicated substantially overstated results of operations” (AAER 1393, 2001).\n\nWith reluctance, Dunlap issued another (rather sudden) press release on March\n19, 1998. The impetus for this was the “due diligence” examination that Morgan Stanley\nhad done in respect of the $500 million bond offering that it was underwriting for\nSunbeam. This “due diligence” study had picked up on the fact that major Sunbeam\ncustomers were overstocked with Sunbeam inventories and that Sunbeam’s sales were\ngoing very slowly in the first quarter of 1998. Morgan Stanley’s attorneys and Sunbeam’s\ninternal and external counsels insisted on a press release disclosing that the company’s\n\n59\n''"

Sunbeam issued\na statement saying that net sales for the first quarter of 1998 “may be lower than the\nrange of Wall Street analysts’ estimates for $285 million to $295 million, but net sales are\nexpected to exceed 1997 first quarter net sales of $253.4 million.” It also stated that the\nshortfall “if any, would be due to changes in inventory management and order patterns\nat certain of the company’s major retail customers.” (Quotes from AAER 1393, 2001)\n\nThe SEC maintained that the “release inaccurately implied that Sunbeam’s lower\nsales to retailers stemmed from a generalized effort among retailers to reduce inven-\ntory levels, rather than from Sunbeam’s 1997 accelerated sales. In addition, information\navailable to Sunbeam management did not provide any basis for projecting net sales in\nexcess of those achieved in the first quarter of 1997” (AAER 1393, 2001).\n\nIndeed, Sunbeam, in an April 3 press release just after its debt offering, announced\nthat it expected to show a loss for the first quarter of 1998. The SEC release noted the\nfollowing:\n\nIn the release and related conference call, Sunbeam management did not disclose:\n\n* the inadequacy of Sunbeam’s reserves for returns,\n\n¢ bill and hold sales that pulled $35 million in net sales into the quarter, and\n\n* the extension of the quarter by two days, which added $20 million in net sales to\nthe quarter. (AAER 1393, 2001)\n\nOn May 11, 1998, Sunbeam issued its first-quarter 1998 earnings release. It did\nnot disclose how accelerated sales in 1997 had drained its current quarter’s sales as it\ndisclosed its loss of 52 cents per share. It also failed to disclose the “positive effect of\nthe first quarter bill and hold sales and the failure to adequately reserve for returned\nproduct.” Furthermore, Sunbeam made predictions for the year that were “contrary to\ninternal analyses.” (Quotes from AAER 1393, 2001)\n\nScheme #2: Improper Use of Restructuring Reserves\n\nAccording to SEC allegations, the other major category of misreporting by Sunbeam was\nthat it created big reserves for the write-down of assets and for future losses or liabilities\nin order to boost future profits. It later “discovered” that these reserves were not needed,\nand it then released those cookie-jar reserves back into earnings. Sunbeam created these\noverstated restructuring reserves upon the implementation of its downsizing and restruc-\nturing ploy and upon its acquisitions of Coleman, First Alert, and Signature Brands.\n\nA legitimate reserve is usually created in recognition of a future liability or loss.\nThe expense is recognized in the current period. When the future payment or loss occurs,\nthe amount is offset against the reserve, and it is not reported as an expense in that later\nperiod. Sometimes companies abuse this procedure, and the SOX Report (SEC Report\nPursuant to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, 2002) described the abuse or improper use as follows:\n\nReserves may be improperly used to manage earnings. These companies typically\ncreate reserves (by initially over-accruing a liability) in one accounting period and\nthen reduce the excess reserves in later accounting periods. The reversal of the\nreserve creates net income that can be used to meet earnings shortfalls.

It is best if the one-time charge has a positive-sounding name,\nsuch as a “restructuring reserve.” In the future, when the expense actually occurs and\nis offset against the reserve instead of being recognized as an expense, the earnings\nare inflated because the expense was moved to an earlier period. It then appears as\nthough the “restructuring” worked and higher profits will recur, and the stock price\noften increases in response. Meanwhile, all that happened after the restructuring was\nthat the company did not have to account for the expenses that were offset by the over-\nstated cookie-jar reserves that had been created earlier.\n\nSunbeam was not shy when it came to creating reserves on its spectacular down-\nsizing restructuring plan. In the last quarter of 1996, it took a very significant restructur-\ning charge. The SEC found that at least $35 million of this was overstated (AAER 1393,\n2001).\n\nIn addition, the SEC found that upon its restructuring, Sunbeam had decreased\nthe carrying value not only of inventory that it was dropping but also of inventory\nthat it would continue to carry normally. As a result, inventory at the end of 1996 was\nunderstated by $2.1 million. Earnings in 1997 would be overstated by this amount when\ninventory was sold.\n\nSunbeam also created a $12 million litigation reserve in the last quarter of 1996\nin respect of a possible environmental action. However, the Commission found that at\nleast $6 million of this reserve was overstated. Also in the last quarter of 1996, Sunbeam\ncreated a cooperative advertising reserve of $21.8 million, which the commission found\nwas created “without any test of the reasonableness” of the amount (AAER 1393, 2001).\n\nThroughout 1997, Sunbeam overstated earnings by releasing parts of these over-\nstated reserves in each quarter. For instance, in the second quarter of 1997, the company\noverstated its earnings by releasing $8.2 million of the non-GAAP overstated restruc-\nturing reserve, and another $5.8 million overstatement of earnings came from the\nrelease of the cooperative advertising reserve. By way of further example, Sunbeam’s\nfourth-quarter earnings were overstated by the release of $1.5 million of the restructur-\ning reserves and by $9 million when the company settled an environmental litigation\ncase for $3 million and could release back into profit the remaining $9 million of the\n$12 million litigation reserve that it had created (AAER 1393, 2001).\n\nIt was in the area of accelerating the recording of future sales that Sunbeam pres-\nents itself as the ultimate case study in pulling every trick in the book to boost sales and\nprofits. Sunbeam created a whole new approach to playing fast and loose as it milked\nthe widespread practice of channel stuffing for every last dollar.\n\nTHE SUNBEAM INFERNO\n\nOn July 19, 1996, the day that Al Dunlap was appointed CEO of Sunbeam, the stock\nprice jumped 56 percent, from $12.50 to $18.63. Wall Street was enthralled at the thought\nthat this slash-and-burn downsizing specialist would quickly boost Sunbeam’s stock\nprice as he had boosted previous companies’ share prices—irrespective of what had\nhappened to those companies after the quick boost. The stock continued to rise after\nDunlap said, in July, that he had begun a study for a downsizing plan that would pro-\nduce a turnaround. By November 12, 1996, the stock price was up in the high $20s. That\nwas the day that Sunbeam announced the actual details of the massive downsizing.\n\n61\n''"

The stock price dropped a little that day but remained in the\nhigh $20 range right into March 1997.\n\nIt was during this first quarter of 1997 that Sunbeam began producing financial\nreports that made it look as though the slashing of facilities, products, jobs, and research\nand development could, in fact, grow sales and earnings. Early in 1997, Sunbeam began\nto release back into earnings the false reserves that it had created upon its restructur-\ning in 1996, It also began to accelerate future periods’ sales into current periods via the\nwide array of tricks discussed earlier. Sunbeam did this for every quarter in 1997, with\nits earnings management reaching its greatest level in the fourth quarter of that year\n(AAER 1393, 2001).\n\nAs previously mentioned, Sunbeam accompanied these misleading sales and\nearnings reports with unrealistic estimates of future growth and without any reference\nto the acceleration of future periods’ sales. Based on these illusory reports of earnings\nand sales growth, as well as unrealistic estimates of future performance, the stock price\nbroke out of the high $20 range in March 1997 and began a steady, steep rocketlike climb\nuntil it peaked at about $52 in March 1998. This occurred a few days after the announce-\nment of Sunbeam’s acquisition of three companies in one day: Coleman, First Alert, and\nSignature Brands. Sunbeam’s stock price had risen 400 percent since Dunlap’s appoint-\nment in July 1996.\n\nHowever, Sunbeam was on the verge of a blazing disintegration. By November\n1998, the stock price had tumbled to about $7 (AAER 1393, 2001). The more Sunbeam\naccelerated future periods’ sales into current periods, the harder it became to achieve\nthe future periods’ sales estimates. The company was caught in an ever-intensifying\nvicious circle. The customers weren’t paying ahead of time for sales that were\nrecorded ahead of time, and worse still, their inventories of Sunbeam products were\nbuilding up steadily. Further, Sunbeam itself was storing massive amounts of these\n“sold” inventories.\n\nWhile so many accepted the downsizing program as an explanation for that all-\ntoo-quick turnaround, for others, the downsizing made a quick growth in sales seem\nimplausible. Some skeptics kept a careful watch for signs of overstated sales and earn-\nings. As early as mid-June 1997, an article in Barron's questioned the validity of the sales\ngrowth in light of the increase in both accounts receivable and inventories (Laing, 1997).\nHowever, this went unheeded by the market, which was blinded by the dazzling stock\nprices. William H. Steele, an analyst for Buckingham Research Group in San Francisco,\ndowngraded Sunbeam to a neutral rating in July 1997 based on the increase in inven-\ntories and on him noticing that “changes in cash from working capital were negative”\n(Byrne, 2003, p. 152). On March 2, 1998, when Dunlap’s new employment contract was\nannounced during a conference call, a Bear Stearn’s analyst, Constance Maneaty, ques-\ntioned Dunlap on whether his generous new options package would be a drag on earn-\nings in the future.\n\nDuring this period, a real threat to the Sunbeam trajectory had been approaching\nin the form of Morgan Stanley’s “due diligence” test for the debt offering that it was\nunderwriting to raise the cash for Sunbeam’s acquisitions of Coleman, First Alert, and\nSignature Brands. While Dunlap was talking up Sunbeam as part of the road show to\ndrum up support for the debt offering, Morgan Stanley’s “due diligence” team had been\nspeaking to Sunbeam managers as well as to Arthur Andersen, the external auditors,\n''"

Everything they heard indicated that Sunbeam’s\nsales estimates for the first quarter of 1998 were not going to be met. Morgan Stanley\nthen approached Sunbeam’s internal counsel, David Fannin, and its external counsel,\nBlaine Fogg, who investigated further. On March 18, it was agreed that a press release\nhad to be issued the next day announcing that Sunbeam might not makes its sales esti-\nmates. When released, however, the statement did not capture the severity of the prob-\nlem. The company acknowledged that sales may be lower than the range of Wail Street\nanalysts’ estimates, but it “expected sales to exceed those of the first quarter of 1997.”\nIt also blamed the shortfall on “changes in inventory management and order patterns.”\nSunbeam’s customers had so much inventory from 1997’s accelerated sales that it was\ncatching up with them in 1998. (Quotes from AAER 1393, 2001).\n\nThe announcement represented the first crack in the armor of Sunbeam’s fagade as a\ncompany whose sales and earnings were growing rapidly. Sunbeam stock fell to $45.375\non the day of the announcement. In spite of this, the company still raised $750 million on\nthe debt offering. Later, this would be to the chagrin of those debtholders. However, the\nquestions as to the validity of Sunbeam’s real sales growth and its estimates were now\nexposed, and with inventory piled up in Sunbeam’s warehouses and in its customers’\nwarehouses, the answers to those questions would continue to impede management's\nefforts to maintain the Sunbeam illusion.\n\nOne day after the Sunbeam press release, on March 20, 1998, the New York\nPost carried an article entitled “Sunbeam’s Cloudy Outlook: Chairman Al Warns\non Profits.” The article questioned whether Dunlap would be able to deliver on\nSunbeam’s estimates of sales growth. More ominously, analyst Andrew Shore was\nreconsidering his earlier upgrade of Sunbeam’s stock. Never a fan of Al Dunlap,\nShore was again hot on the trail of stories of inventory piling up. He had also heard\nstories of turmoil within Sunbeam.\n\nIn early April, Shore received a tip-off that Sunbeam’s head of domestic sales,\nDonald Uzzi, had been fired. The company was desperate to keep this quiet because\nUzzi had been carrying an enormous load in trying to keep Sunbeam’s sales from fall-\ning apart altogether. With the rumors of Uzzi’s departure, as well as the resignation\nof Richard Goudis, head of corporate planning, Shore thought he had to take the risk\nof downgrading Sunbeam’s stock on a “conference call that linked analysts in New\nYork with more than 5,000 stockbrokers around the world. It had an electrifying effect.\nSunbeam’s stock began to plunge, falling $4 within minutes” (Byrne, 2003, pp. 241, 242).\nIf he was wrong, Shore’s reputation would be in shreds. A few hours later, Shore was\nrelieved to get confirmation that his call was correct when Sunbeam ’s internal counsel\ninsisted on the release of a press statement explaining the following:\n\n¢ Sunbeam now expected to make a loss in the first quarter of 1998.\n\n* Sales would not meet the amount predicted in Sunbeam’s March release a few\nweeks earlier.\n\n¢ Sales would be less than in the comparative first quarter of 1997 (AAER 1393, 2001).\n\nThat same day, Sunbeam’s stock fell almost 25 percent, to $34.38. Andrew Shore\nwas vindicated and congratulated. Sunbeam’s internal auditor, Deidra DenDanto, who\nhad been sidelined by management with her concerns about the bill and hold sales,\nresigned the same day. Russell Kersh, the chief financial officer of Sunbeam who had the\nultimate responsibility for the accounting misstatements, could now just watch as the\n\n63\n''"

As for Dunlap, he continued\nto “gloss over the first quarter repercussions of [Sunbeam’s] 1997 earnings management\nas a surprising slowdown” (AAER 1393, 2001).\n\nWall Street analysts began to downgrade Sunbeam’s stock and investigative\njournalists began to search for the telltale signs of fraud: growing accounts receiv-\nable and mounting inventory. The problem with a fictitiously recorded sale is that\nit remains as accounts receivable. It does not turn into cash like an honest sale. Also,\nthe inventory of a bill and hold sale must build up somewhere—either at the seller’s\nor the buyer’s warehouses. Furthermore, cash flow from operations (CFFO) lags the\nfalsely reported profits and it becomes difficult to make sales in the following peri-\nods. CFFO refers to the amount of cash generated from the company’s main operat-\ning activities. It generally refers to the increase or decrease in the actual amount of\ncash in a period as a result of sales or services rendered or the performance of some\nother operating activities and the related expenses. It is more formally referred to\nas cash flows from operating activities. Wall Street was finally catching on to Dunlap’s\n“turnarounds,” and so was the media. According to an article in Forbes magazine,\n“Seven months ago Al Dunlap declared victory in turning around ... Sunbeam.... But\nsince the middle of March its stock has fallen nearly 50% from $52 to a recent $28....\nThis turnaround hasn’t turned and it isn’t likely to.” The article went on to point out\nhow, in December 1997, Sunbeam had “sold $60 million in accounts receivable to\nraise cash.” Unfortunately, however, analysts had not questioned Sunbeam’s num-\nbers. “If they had, they might have seen that Sunbeam was coming apart.” (Quotes\nfrom Schifrin, 1998)\n\nDuring a meeting with financial analysts on May 11, Sunbeam announced another\ndownsizing plan. In respect of its acquisition of Coleman, Signature Brands, and First\nAlert, Sunbeam planned to eliminate 6,400 jobs and close 8 of 24 plants. The New York\nTimes, on May 12, noted that in the analysts’ meeting, “Mr. Dunlap attributed the ‘early\nbuy’ debacle to everything from a marketing executive who approved ‘stupid deals’ with\nretailers to El Nino.... Whatever the reason, the dismal performance was worse than inves-\ntors had anticipated” (Canedy, 1998c). Worse was coming.\n\nThe final blast of the explosion for Dunlap and CFO Russell Kersh came a few\nweeks later in the form of an article by Jonathan Laing in Barron’s magazine. Laing\nbelieved that “the earnings from Sunbeam’s supposed breakthrough year appear to be\nlargely manufactured.” The article speculated that much of the supposed earnings had\ncome from releasing back into earnings the overstated reserves that had been created\nupon Sunbeam’s restructuring charge in 1996. Furthermore, the exposé assumed that,\nat the time, Sunbeam had also written down property, plant, and equipment values\nto reduce future depreciation expenses and observed that earnings were boosted by a\ndrop in Sunbeam’s allowance for doubtful debts and discounts. It was also suspicious\nthat “Sunbeam’s inventories exploded by some 40% or $93 million, during 1997.” In\naddition, there were “indications that Sunbeam jammed as many sales as it could into\n1997 to pump both the top and bottom lines.” The article in Barron's provided the final\nspark that exploded the Sunbeam facade. (Quotes from Laing, 1998b, pp. 18-19)\n\nThe following Monday, Sunbeam put out a press release saying that there was\nno factual support for the accusation in the Barron’s article that Sunbeam had largely\ninvented its profits. The release was rather problematic, however, because it was very\ngeneral and did not answer the specific questions raised. The next day, Sunbeam held\n''"

The gathering\nincluded internal and external counsel, as well as Russell Kersh (CFO), Robert Gluck\n(controller), and Phillip Harlow (external auditor from Arthur Anderson). At the meet-\ning, the directors found no comfort from the answers they received about the account-\ning numbers or about the strength of the current quarter. Further, Dunlap and Kersh\nindicated that if they didn’t get more support from the board of directors, they might\ntender their resignations. After the meeting broke up, the external directors discussed\nthe situation and concluded that it looked like the end of the line for Dunlap—and\npossibly for Sunbeam as well. In the next few days, Fannin, the general counsel, met\nwith the external counsel. They carried out further internal investigations. In his book,\nChainsaw, John Byrne (2003) explained how, on Saturday, June 13, Fannin and the out-\nside directors met secretly. They decided that they should get rid of Dunlap and Kersh\nby accepting their offers to resign as tendered at the previous board meeting. Another\nboard meeting was convened, and telephone calls were made to Dunlap and Kersh.\nWith the jobs of the two men on the line, Peter Langerman, one of the directors, read to\nthem from a prepared statement:\nHere is what we propose:\n\n1. You be removed from all positions with the company and its subsidiaries imme-\ndiately. You may continue to serve as a director of Sunbeam unless you choose to\nresign from that position.\n\n2. The board names a new Chairman of the Board and we expand our ongoing search\nto encompass a search for your successor... (Qtd. in Byrne, 2003, p. 324)\n\nAfter firing Dunlap and Kersh, Langerman continued to investigate the depth of\nSunbeam’s problems. He learned that Sunbeam might contravene its debt covenants by\nthe end of the month and that huge loans could become repayable. The board of direc-\ntors realized that bankruptcy was a possibility and they decided to ask Ron Perelman\n(of Revlon Cosmetics) if he would arrange for Jerry Levin (who had been the CEO of\nColeman) to run Sunbeam for a while. (Perelman had acquired a significant amount of\nSunbeam stock on the sale of his company, Coleman, to Sunbeam.) Levin agreed to the\nrequest and began by rehiring executives who had quit under Dunlap. Then he initiated\na thorough analysis of the financial statements. The SEC also began an investigation of\nSunbeam in June. Arthur Andersen, the external auditors, began a review of Sunbeam’s\nprevious financial statements. It was immediately apparent to Levin, Arthur Andersen,\nand the SEC that Sunbeam’s financial statements would have to be restated. An ongoing\ninvestigation would have to determine the amount of the restatements.\n\nIn November 1998, as a result of the investigations, Sunbeam “issued substan-\ntially restated financial statements for the six quarters from the fourth quarter of 1996\nthrough the first quarter of 1998. As a result of the restatement for 1997, Sunbeam\nreported $93 million in income, approximately one half of the amount it had previously\nreported” (AAER 1393, 2001). Sunbeam had inflated its 1997 income alone by close to\n100 percent. Sunbeam’s amazing resurrection had been nothing more than a “manufac-\ntured illusion” (Byrne, 2003, p. 345).\n\nWithin weeks of the firing of Dunlap, the stock price had fallen to below $10 per\nshare. After the October announcements of the required restatements, Sunbeam was\ntrading in the $7 range, a spectacular plunge from its peak of about $52 per share a mere\neight months earlier (AAER 1393, 2001).\n\n65\n''"

Under the reorganization plan, most of\nthe bank debt would be converted to equity and shareholders would receive nothing\n(“Bankruptcy Judge,” 2002).\n\nSIGNALS OF SUNBEAM’S SCHEMES\n\nThere were several indications that Sunbeam may have engaged in fictitious financial\nreporting. Here is an examination of some of these signals.\n\nSignals of Sunbeam’s Fictitious Reporting Scheme #1—Improper\nTiming of Revenue Recognition via Bill and Hold Sales, Consignment\nSales, and Other Contingency Sales\n\nNumerous signals could have alerted investors to the fictitious reporting schemes asso-\nciated with improper timing of revenue recognition.\n\nSIGNAL #1: QUALITY OF LEADERSHIP The quality of a company’s leadership is an\nimportant signal with regard to whether its financial statements are likely to be fraudu-\nlently reported. The ethics, ability, management style, and track record of the leader-\nship of the company should be the first piece of evidence an analyst or investor looks at\nin conjunction with examining financial reports for credibility. The track record of the\ncompanies that Dunlap had managed before joining Sunbeam, most notably Scott Paper,\nmade Andrew Shore a skeptic of Sunbeam’s reported “turnaround” right from the start.\nBecause of his long-term doubts about Dunlap, on the morning of April 3, 1998, just\nbefore Sunbeam’s press release that it was not going to make its estimates for the first\nquarter of 1998, Shore was the first analyst to put in a downgrade on Sunbeam stock.\n\nThis general signal of the quality and track record of company leaders should be com-\nbined with an analysis of whether the business plan outlined by management is likely to\nproduce the reported results as published in the financial statements. Sunbeam’s vicious\ncost-cutting plan of closing production plants and cutting products, jobs, and R&D expen-\nditure was not likely to lead to fast sales growth as reported in record numbers in 1997. The\nimplausibility of the reported financial results in relation to Sunbeam’s major downsizing\nplan was a major signal of fictitious financial reporting.\n\nSIGNAL #2: INCREASE IN ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AS A PERCENTAGE OF SALES The\nleading sign of an overstatement of sales is when accounts receivable increase as a per-\ncentage of sales, which is often measured as days sales outstanding (DSO). If the next\nperiod’s sales have been accelerated into the current period or if the sales are com-\npletely fictitious, the company will debit accounts receivable and credit sales, as for\nlegitimate sales. However, whereas legitimate sales will be paid relatively soon by the\ncustomers and will turn into cash, the next period’s sales will probably be paid only in\nthe next period and will remain on the balance sheet in the current period as accounts\nreceivable instead of turning into cash.\n\nThis signal of an overstatement of sales (and the accompanying profit) is easy\nto spot. We simply look at the income statement, extract the sales figures, look at the\n''"

To illustrate the validity of this technique, let us\nexamine an extract from Sunbeam’s income statements in Table 3.1 and an extract from\nits balance sheet in Table 3.2. If we divide accounts receivable at the end of any quarter\nby the addition of the sales for the four quarters ending on that date (ie. the trailing\ntwelve months’ sales), we see the trend of accounts receivable growing as a percentage\nof sales, as shown in Table 3.3, from 29 percent of sales in the first quarter of 1997 to\nalmost 49 percent of sales in the first quarter of 1998.\n\nSIGNAL #3: SUDDEN CHANGE IN GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE The third sign to look for\nas an indicator of illegitimately reported sales is a sudden change in the gross margin\npercentage—sales less the cost of goods sold expressed as a percentage of sales. It is dif-\nficult for a manufacturer suddenly to increase the company’s gross margin percentage;\nit is also suspicious if the gross margin fluctuates downward suddenly. It is easy to find\nthis signal. A simple perusal of the income statements over a number of quarters will\nalert the investor to suspicious changes in the gross margin percentage. Look at extracts\nfrom Sunbeam’s quarterly income statements in Table 3.1. Calculating gross margin as\na percentage of sales, as shown in Table 3.4, reveals sudden changes in the gross margin\nover the quarters, from 19 percent in the second quarter of 1996 to negative 15 percent\nin the fourth quarter of 1996. This was followed by a suspicious improvement in 1997\n(after the so-called “turnaround”) to 27 percent in the first quarter of 1997 to 31 percent\nin the third quarter of 1997, then falling to 13 percent in the first quarter of 1998 and to\nnegative 9 percent in the second quarter of 1998.\n\nThese sudden changes in gross margins were probably due, in part, to practices\nsuch as selling inventory in 1997 at higher prices than the restructuring purported to\nanticipate because some inventory had been valued at incorrectly low amounts. Also,\nSunbeam’s schemes—for example, understating the reserve for returns and taking the\nbenefits of rebates for future purchases into the current period—would have falsely\nboosted the gross margins in 1997 and in the first quarter of 1998.\n\nSIGNAL #4: CFFO FALLING BEHIND OPERATING INCOME The fourth signal of inappro-\npriately recorded sales is when CFFO lags behind operating income or when CFFO falls\nrelative to operating income. For this information, once again we simply look at the\nfinancial statements filed with the SEC. For the first three quarters of 1997, we see that\nSunbeam reported operating income of $132 million in its income statement. However,\nlooking at the statement of cash flows, we see that Sunbeam’s CFFO for the same period\nwas negative. This signal is a huge red flag. If Sunbeam was operating at such a great\nprofit, why would it be burning through operating cash?\n\nThe statement of cash flows is separated into three segments: the cash flows from\noperating activities, the cash flows from investing activities, and the cash flows\nfrom financing the business. So the “cash flow from operations” (CFFO) should not show\nan amount of cash generated that is significantly less than the profit from operations—\nlisted as “operating income” or “operating earnings” in the income statement—without\na very specific explanation.\n\nCertainly, from the first four signals alone, anybody reading Sunbeam’s finan-\ncial statements at the end of 1997 should have been alerted to the fact that its reported\nsales and operating profits were unreliable. The sales were simply not turning into\n\n67\n''"

The leading example of such an aggressive policy is the\npractice of recognizing sales revenue before the goods are shipped to the customer. The\ntwo major accounting strategies for doing this are “bill and hold sales” and “percentage\nof completion” accounting for contracts in progress. For Sunbeam, the relevant method\nin this category of overstatement of sales and profit was its bill and hold sales to get\ncustomers to place later periods’ orders long before they would pay for the goods and\nlong before Sunbeam delivered the goods to the customers. Of $35 million of bill and\nhold sales that Sunbeam recognized in the fourth quarter of 1997, $29 million was later\nreversed and restated as future periods’ sales.\n\nIn the case of Sunbeam, this signal was easy to spot. One of the notes to the finan-\ncial statements in the company’s 1997 Annual Report mentioned this policy.\n\nThe lesson here is to read the notes and footnotes to quarterly and annual financial\nstatements and search for any new, aggressive policies indicating that the company\nrecords sales before the goods are delivered.\n\nSIGNAL #6: LARGE DISCOUNTS AND EXTENDED PAYMENT TERMS When a company\noffers large discounts and extended payment terms to entice its customers to order\nearly, it is a signal that the reported sales for the current period are overstated and\nthat future sales will be impoverished by the early placement of the orders. The notes\nto the financial statements in Sunbeam’s quarterly reports (Form 10-Q) should have\ndisclosed this under Regulation S-K, items 101 and 103. However, Sunbeam failed to\ndivulge this information (AAER 1393, 2001). To get information on this kind of channel\n\n69\n''"

They should search for data indicating that the company is offering unusu-\nally generous payment terms or discounts. If necessary, one could even interview the\ncompany’s staff and customers, as was done in the due diligence tests by the underwrit-\ners of Sunbeam’s debt offering in 1998.\n\nIn addition, any news reports of large warehouses being built to house the com-\npany’s inventory (as was the case with Sunbeam) or of a company’s major customers\nbuilding warehouses or “reclamation centers” to store unsold or returnable inventory\nshould be taken as huge red flags that companies may have accelerated current sales at\nthe expense of future sales.\n\nSIGNAL #7: GUARANTEED SALES The recording of sales when the customer has a\nright to return the product is a signal of the overstatement of sales. Such sales are\noften known as “guaranteed sales,” where the customers can return goods if they are\nunable to resell them or they can get a reimbursement if they cannot achieve a certain\nresale selling price or a guaranteed markup. In Sunbeam’s case, the SEC found that\n“in total, $24.7 million in fourth quarter [1997] sales to distributors were subject to\nrights of return” (AAER 1393, 2001). A reserve for such returns should be accounted\nfor in the financial statements according to the Financial Accounting Standards\nBoard’s SFAS 48’. However, the SEC reported that because such sales were a signifi-\ncant change in approach for Sunbeam and the likely return amounts were not known,\nit should not have reported these sales.\n\nAn investor or analyst should search the financial statements for any disclosure\nof recording such sales (although in some cases, like that of Sunbeam, a change in\napproach may not be properly disclosed). One should also look for media reports about\nsignificant changes in company policy or about either the company or its customers\nbuilding reclamation centers or warehouses. Again, these are all telltale signs of returns\nwaiting to happen.\n\nSIGNAL #8: PRESS RELEASES STATING INABILITY TO MEET SALES ESTIMATES Press\nreleases indicating that previous sales growth estimates will not be met are clear warn-\ning signals. It is a strong indication of a desperate overstatement of sales and sales esti-\nmates when a company issues a second press release, downwardly revising the num-\nbers of an earlier press release that was, itself, a downward revision of sales estimates.\nThis was the case with Sunbeam’s March and April press releases discussed earlier.\nPerform Internet or database searches for press releases or for articles referring to press\nreleases that revise earlier public statements in quick succession.\n\nSignals of Sunbeam’s Fictitious Reporting Scheme #2—Overstating\nEarnings via Improper Use of Restructuring Reserves\n\nThere were also signals that should have uncovered the overstatement of earnings\nthrough the improper use of restructuring reserves.\n\n \n\n* Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 48. www.fasb.org.\n''"

Sunbeam’s income statement showed a massive restructuring charge of\n$154.9 million in the last quarter of 1996 that included the over-accruals for items such as\nthe advertising reserve and the litigation reserve.\n\nSIGNAL #2: RESTRUCTURING RESERVES If restructuring reserves or reserves resulting\nfrom other one-time charges appear in the financial statements upon the arrival of a\nnew CEO, it is an even stronger alert that future expenses are possibly being recog-\nnized early with the creation of improper reserves. Al Dunlap was appointed CEO of\nSunbeam on July 18, 1996, and the massive restructuring reserves were created in the\nlast quarter of 1996.\n\nSIGNAL #3: RAPID DECREASE IN RESERVES When reserves decrease rapidly, it is an\nindication that earnings in the period may have been inflated by avoiding expenses\nthrough the reversal of the reserves. One has to consider how the company will be\nable to continue showing profits in the future when it can no longer release reserves\nto bolster profits. Sunbeam’s restructuring accrual decreased from $63.8 million in\nthe last quarter of 1996 to $45.3 million in the first quarter of 1997, and then it was\nreleased steadily until it reached zero at the end of the first quarter of 1998.\n\nSIGNAL #4: CFFO SIGNIFICANTLY LESS THAN OPERATING INCOME The release of cookie-\njar reserves boosts operating income but does not produce cash flow. Therefore, once\nagain, CFFO lagging or falling behind operating income is a signal of this method of\nfictitious reporting. In Sunbeam’s financial statements, the effect of releasing cookie-jar\nreserves together with accelerating sales (as discussed in Scheme 1), combined to pro-\nvide a very strong signal of its extremely aggressive earnings management.\n\nTo discover this manipulation, search the financial statements for large one-time\ncharges in the income statement or for reserves decreasing in later periods on the balance\nsheet. When Sunbeam simultaneously reported large operating profits in 1997 but nega-\ntive CFFO, it was a signal to bail out of the company and its stock as quickly as possible.\n\nARE THEY LIVING HAPPILY EVER AFTER?°\n\n¢ Al Dunlap, Sunbeam’s former CEO and chairman, settled a $15 million class-\naction lawsuit with Sunbeam shareholders in 2002. In a civil settlement with the\nSEC that same year, and without admitting or denying the allegations, Dunlap\nagreed to a civil penalty of $500,000 and was prevented from ever again acting as\nan officer or a director of a public company (LR 17710, 2002).\nDunlap and his wife Judy are reportedly living on a horse farm in Ocala,\nFlorida, and have a summer home in Hilton Head, South Carolina. In 2006, the\nDunlaps gave a substantial gift to Florida State University (Murphy & Ray, 2006).\n\n \n\n> The “Are They Living Happily Ever After?” sections in this book present selected information about certain\npeople and companies and are not meant to be definitive or exhaustive lists.\n\n71\n''"

He was\nsoon dubbed “Dr. Chainsaw” (Porter & Dizik, 2007).\n\nIn 2009, Dunlap was named the sixth worst CEO of all time (“Portfolio’s\nWorst American CEOs of All Time”).\n\nNow in his late 70s, Dunlap insists that he is not the ferocious person the\nmedia reported him to be while he was at Sunbeam. He is described as a life-\nlong German shepherd lover and apparently despises his infamous nickname of\nChainsaw AI (Florian & Adamo, 2010).\n\nRussell Kersh, Sunbeam’s former chief financial officer, agreed to a civil penalty\nof $200,000 without admitting or denying the allegations. He was barred from\never again acting as an officer or director of a public company (LR 17710, 2002).\nMorgan Stanley was found liable for fraud by a jury in May 2005. The invest-\nment firm was ordered to pay a total of over $1.4 billion in “compensatory and\npunitive damages” in respect of the sale of Ron Perelman’s Coleman Company to\nSunbeam in 1998. Perelman had lost close to $1 billion when Sunbeam collapsed.\nMorgan Stanley appealed the verdict, claiming that it too was “a victim of the\nSunbeam fraud” (“Morgan Stanley ...,” 2005).\n\nIn 2007, an appeals court in Florida reversed the jury verdict against Morgan\nStanley (Thomas, Jr., 2007).\n\nSunbeam emerged from bankruptcy in 2002 as American Household, Inc., which\nwas then acquired by Jarden Corporation in January 2005 (“Jarden,” 2005).\n\n \n\nKey Terms\nBill and hold sales 13 Cookie-jar reserves 14 Improper timing of\nCash flow from operations Downsizing 2 revenue recognition 12\n(CFFO) 20 FOB destination 13 Restructuring plan 7\nChannel stuffing 15 FOB shipping 13 Revenue recognition 13\nCommon or allocated fixed Gross margin percentage 23 Traceable fixed costs 8\ncosts 8\nETHICS AT WORK\nQuestions:\n\na. Approaching ethics from a utilitarian framework, discuss whether or not the manage-\n\nment of Sunbeam was unethical in issuing financial statements that improperly timed\nSunbeam’s revenue recognition. Identify the major stakeholders in this case. (Refer to\nChapter 2, “Ethics at Work,” for a description of the utilitarian framework.)\n\n. Do you believe that trading a company’s stock with the knowledge that the company’s\n\nearnings are overstated is unethical? Explain why or why not within the context of the\njustice approach to ethical decision making. (Refer to Chapter 2 for a description of the\njustice approach.)\n''"

In certain periods between 2000 and 2007, Beazer, acting through certain of its\nofficers and employees, fraudulently misstated its net income for the purpose of improp-\nerly managing its quarterly and annual earnings. In May 2008, as a result of its earnings\nmanagement and other errors, Beazer restated its financial statements to reflect adjust-\nments for the fiscal years 1998 through 2006, as well as the first and second quarters\nof fiscal year 2007. Beazer restated its fiscal year 2006 net income from $389 million to\n$369 million (a reduction of $20 million or 5%). Beazer also restated its fiscal 2005 net\nincome from $263 million to $276 million (an increase of $13 million or 5%) and increased\nits beginning retained earnings for the fiscal year 2005 by $34 million (from $742 million\nto $776 million or 5%) to reflect the cumulative effect of adjustments for the fiscal years\n1998 through 2004. Finally, Beazer also restated its net loss for the first quarter of fiscal\nyear 2007 from $59 million to $80 million (an increased loss of $21 million or 36%), and\nits net loss for the second quarter of fiscal year 2007 from $43 million to $57 million (an\nincreased loss of $14 million or 33%).\n\nRespondent\n\n2. Beazer, a Delaware corporation headquartered in Atlanta, Georgia, is a home-\nbuilder with operations in at least twenty-one states. Since March 1994, Beazer’s com-\nmon stock has been registered with the Commission pursuant to Section 12(b) of the\nExchange Act and listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol BZH. On\nJune 6, 2006, Beazer issued and sold a $275 million aggregate amount of its 8.125% Senior\nNotes due 2016 in a private placement to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule\n144A and in offshore transactions pursuant to Regulation S. On August 15, 2006, Beazer\nfiled an S-4 registration statement offering to exchange $275 million in new notes for the\nnotes issued on June 6, 2006. The prospectus filed with the registration statement incor-\nporates by reference Respondent’s annual and quarterly reports. In a June 2006 private\nplacement, Beazer also issued $103 million of junior subordinated notes. Additionally,\nin November 2005, Beazer announced an increase to 10 million shares of its prior repur-\nchase plan which resulted in 3.65 million of its shares being repurchased during fiscal\n2006 for an aggregate purchase price of $205.4 million.\n\nBeazer's Earnings Management\n\n3.

From approximately 2000 to 2005,\na period of strong growth and financial performance for Beazer, Beazer decreased its\nreported net income by improperly increasing certain reported operating expenses. This\ncreated improper accruals, or “reserves,” in Beazer’s books and records. In certain quar-\nters, the existence of these reserves had the effect of smoothing Beazer’s earnings, i.e.,\nallowing Beazer to report earnings that still met or exceeded analysts’ expectations for its\nquarterly net income and earnings per share (“EPS”) while permitting it to improperly\ndefer a portion of its income to future periods.\n\n4, Beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year 2006, Beazer’s financial performance\nbegan to decline. In order to continue to meet or exceed analysts’ expectations for its\nquarterly net income and EPS, Beazer began reversing many of its previously created,\nimproper reserves. In certain instances, Beazer also began purposefully not recognizing\ncertain current period expenses. These actions had the effect of reducing Beazer’s operat-\ning expenses and thereby improperly increasing its net income.\n\n5. Additionally during fiscal 2006 and the first two quarters of fiscal 2007,\nBeazer, again acting through certain of its officers and employees, improperly\nrecognized income from the sale of approximately 360 model homes to three\nseparate investor pools compiled and sponsored by a third party entity (the\n“Investor Pools”).\n\nThe Improper Accruals and Reversals\n\n6. Between approximately 2000 and 2007, Beazer created, and later reversed,\nimproper accruals and reserves by, among other ways, manipulating the amounts\nrecorded in two series of accounts in order to manage earnings. These accounts were the\nland inventory accounts and the house cost to complete accounts.\n\n7. The Land Inventory Accounts. As part of its homebuilding and sales operations,\nBeazer regularly acquired large parcels of land upon which it constructed houses. Beazer\nrecorded this purchased land as an asset on its balance sheet in accounts denoted as\n“land inventory accounts.” Also recorded in these accounts were capitalized costs for\nthe common development of the parcel, such as costs for sewer systems and streets. Each\nBeazer subdivision under construction had at least one land inventory account associ-\nated with it in Beazer’s general ledger.\n\n8. As subdivisions were built, Beazer allocated the land acquisition cost, as well\nas past and future common development costs, to individual home lots which were\nthen offered for sale. When a home sale was recorded in Beazer’s general ledger, all\nassociated homebuilding costs, including the costs of the land recorded in the land\ninventory account, were expensed to cost of sales. As part of these journal entries, the\nland inventory account was reduced and a cost of sales expense account increased\nto reflect the value of the land and improvements that Beazer sold with the house.\nBecause Beazer sold houses within a subdivision as the development of that sub-\ndivision progressed, the land expense recorded for any particular house sale was\nnecessarily an estimate. As individual houses in a development were sold, the land\ninventory accounts were decreased by an amount representing the amounts of the\nland and development costs allocated to each individual house.

In certain quarters between 2000 through 2007, however, Beazer, acting\nthrough certain officers and employees, manipulated the amounts recorded in the\nland inventory accounts in order to manage earnings. Specifically, in various quarters\nduring fiscal years 2000 through 2005, Beazer over-allocated land inventory expense\nto individual properties sold. This over-allocation caused Beazer to report more\nexpense and less profit on each sold house in certain subdivisions. When all or most of\nthe houses in a development were eventually sold, these over-allocations resulted in\nthe affected land inventory accounts having negative (or credit) balances. The credit\nbalances that resulted from the intentional over-allocation were then improperly held\nopen in Beazer’s general ledger—acting, in effect, as improper reserves. By these\nactions, Beazer understated its net income by a total of $42 million for fiscal years 2000\nthrough 2005.\n\n10. Beginning at least by the second quarter of 2006, Beazer, acting through cer-\ntain officers and employees, began to reverse the excess reserves existing in the land\ninventory accounts, which increased then-current period earnings. The credit bal-\nances in land inventory accounts were debited, i.e., zeroed out, and a cost of sales\nexpense credited, i.e., reduced. This improperly reduced expenses and increased\nBeazer’s earnings. During 2006, Beazer overstated its cumulative reported net income\nof $389 million by $16 million by “zeroing out” credit balances in its land inventory\naccounts. For the first two quarters of fiscal 2007, Beazer understated its cumulative\nreported net loss of $102 million by $1 million due to the reversal of improper land\ninventory reserves.\n\n11. The House Cost to Complete Accounts. Under its accounting policies, Beazer\nrecorded revenue and profit on the sale of a house after the close of the sale of that house\nto a third party. In the journal entries to record the sale, Beazer typically reserved a por-\ntion of its profit earned on the house. This reserve, called a “house cost to complete”\nreserve, was established to cover any known and unknown expenses that Beazer might\nincur on the sold house after the close, such as outstanding invoices, unbudgeted cost\noverruns, minor repairs or final cosmetic touchups. Although the amount of this reserve\nvaried by region, it was typically $2,000 to $4,000 per house, above known outstanding\ninvoices. Beazer’s policy was to reverse any unused portion of the house cost to complete\nreserve within four to nine months after the house’s close, taking any unused portion\ninto income at that time. Although creation of such a house cost to complete reserve is\nproper, in some instances, Beazer, acting through certain officers and employees, utilized\nthese reserves to manage improperly its earnings. In various quarters between 2000 and\n2005, Beazer over-reserved house cost to complete expenses in order to defer profit to\nfuture periods. In later periods, Beazer eliminated these cost to complete reserves, result-\ning in inflated profits for those periods. In certain instances, Beazer also purposefully did\nnot recognize certain current period house cost to complete expenses, again resulting in\ninflated profits for those periods.\n\n12. Between fiscal years 2000 and 2005, Beazer understated its net income by\n$6 million due to excess house cost to complete accruals. During fiscal year 2006, when\nBeazer began to reverse some of the excess accruals, Respondent overstated its net\n\n \n\n81\n''"

Beazer also understated its cumulative net loss for the first\ntwo quarters of fiscal 2007 by $1 million.\n\nThe Sale-Leaseback Transactions\n\n13. As part of its marketing activities, Beazer typically builds and furnishes\nbetween one and five model homes for each of its housing developments. Prior to\n2006, Beazer typically retained ownership of the large majority (upwards of 70-80%)\nof its model homes, and entered into sale-leaseback arrangements with third par-\nties for the remaining ones. Beginning in fiscal 2006, Beazer significantly increased\nthe number of model homes it leased. At the end of fiscal 2006, Beazer had leased\n557 of its 793 model homes or 70%. Beazer improperly accounted for more than\nhalf of these leased model homes as sale-leasebacks in order to improve Beazer’s\nfinancial results.\n\n14. Specifically, beginning near the end of fiscal 2005, Beazer, acting through cer-\ntain of its officers and employees, engaged in negotiations with the third party entity\nrepresenting the Investor Pools concerning possible sale-leaseback transactions for\nBeazer’s model homes. Pursuant to the transaction terms under discussion, the Investor\nPools would purchase certain Beazer model homes at 92% of the homes’ appraised\nvalue. Beazer would then lease the model homes, at monthly lease payments equal to\nthe Investor Pools’ purchase price multiplied by the current 30 day LIBOR rate plus 450\nbasis points (prorated on a monthly basis). Beazer would also retain a right to receive a\npercentage of the appreciation of the model home upon its sale at the end of the lease\nterm (the “Appreciation Rights”).\n\n15. However, Beazer’s outside auditor informed certain Beazer officers and\nemployees that any Appreciation Rights represented a “continuing interest” that, pursu-\nant to Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”), required Beazer to record\nthe transactions as financing, not as sale-leasebacks. This proper accounting treatment\nwould not have permitted Beazer to record the model home sales revenue and profit at\nthe beginning of the lease term.\n\n16. In order to circumvent GAAP, and deceive its outside auditor, Beazer, act-\ning through certain officers and employees, caused the model home sale-leaseback\nwritten agreements with the Investor Pools to omit any reference to Appreciation\nRights and recorded the model home transactions as sale-leasebacks, recognizing\nhome sales revenue in fiscal 2006. Based upon the terms of the written agreements,\nthe outside auditor agreed that the transactions qualified for sale-leaseback account-\ning. However, unbeknownst to the outside auditor, Beazer, acting through certain\nofficers and employees, and the Investor Pools had also entered into oral side agree-\nments which contained the Appreciation Rights, and allowed Beazer to receive a\npercentage of the model homes’ price appreciation upon their sale at the end of the\nlease term.\n\n17. As a result of Beazer’s improper recording of these transactions as sale-lease-\nbacks, Beazer overstated its fiscal year 2006 revenues by $117 million and net income by\n$14 million. For the first two quarters of fiscal 2007, Beazer understated its cumulative\nrevenue by $2.6 million and overstated its cumulative net loss by $3.9 million due to the\nimproper sale-leasebacks accounting.\n''"

              "value": "94\n\nChapter 4 * Hocus Pocus\n\nIn a speech given several years ago, past SEC chairman Arthur Levitt (1998) spoke\nabout the numerous companies that “operate in the gray area between legitimacy and\noutright fraud.” He observed, “Integrity may be losing out to illusion.” In order to\nachieve these illusory earnings and fabricated balance sheets, many companies resort to\nwhat Levitt described as “hocus pocus.”\n\nThis chapter presents a brief overview of, at worst, some of the lesser-known,\nintentional revenue-recognition accounting frauds or, at best, misguided attempts to\n“improve” a company’s financial statements with aggressive accounting. In all cases,\nhowever, the main objective was either to boost the appearance of corporate profits or\nto enhance the seeming strength of the balance sheets. In most cases, company person-\nnel achieved this using their own versions of hocus pocus.\n\nWhy are so many company executives prepared to resort to such desperate mea-\nsures to misrepresent or falsify accounting records? Some of the reasons are quite obvi-\nous: better balance sheets or greater earnings mean more investors, increased stock\nprices, more valuable stock options, bigger bonuses, improved financing terms, and so\non. Essentially, all these reasons boil down to one basic and obvious motivating force—\ngreed. However, there are other reasons that are not quite so apparent. As with Enron\nand WorldCom, many of the companies discussed in this chapter were managed pre-\ndominately by men who at times seemed charismatic and plausible, men with strong\npersonalities and even stronger egos. Some were desperate to avoid the embarrassment\nof failure at any cost. Others started to believe that they were immune to mundane rules\nand regulations.\n\nSENSORMATIC: MADNESS AT MIDNIGHT\n\nSensormatic is presented mainly as an example of Improper Timing of Revenue Recognition\nvia holding books open after the close of a reporting period.\n\nSensormatic Electronics Corporation was a publicly traded company, registered in\nDelaware, with its head office located in Boca Raton, Florida. The company is still\nin existence but is no longer a public company. Sensormatic manufactures electronic\nsecurity systems and is probably best known for its anti-shoplifting security devices.\nIt was known on Wall Street for meeting its budgeted figures for revenues and\nearnings. Moreover, these estimates were quite aggressive. For example, Sensormatic\nbudgeted for revenue growth of over 20 percent per year over the period of 1988-\n1995. The company began facing enormous difficulty in meeting these phenomenal\ngrowth projections from at least the first quarter of its 1994 fiscal year. Surprisingly,\ndespite this difficulty, Sensormatic’s quarterly financial reports continued to meet\nanalysts’ earnings forecasts almost to the cent. Sensormatic’s management was\nfully committed to meeting these forecasts and apparently became quite creative in\nthis regard.\n\nIn its proceedings against Sensormatic, the SEC examined the roles of a number\nof former senior executives of the company, including Ronald Assaf (former CEO),\nMichael Pardue (former COO and CFO), and Lawrence Simmons (former vice presi-\ndent of finance).\n''"

              "value": "Chapter 4 ¢ Hocus Pocus\n\nSensormatic is presented mainly as an example of improper timing of revenue\nrecognition via holding books open after the close of a reporting period. Sensormatic’s\nstock was used to finance acquisitions, and the stock price was sensitive to the com-\npany’s revenue growth and to analysts’ revenue and earnings estimates. Therefore,\nsenior management was highly motivated to communicate positive information on\nSensormatic’s financial position and prospects to stock analysts. Management was also\naware of Sensormatic’s high price-to-earnings ratio as well as the effect that faliering\ngrowth would have on the stock price. Senior executives became too eager in their quest\nto deliver earnings and revenue figures that met analysts’ high growth expectations in\nevery single quarter. Sales were lower in the third quarter of each year due to seasonal\nvariables, and this quarter generally provided the biggest challenge. By the 1994 fiscal\nyear, all quarters received significant assistance from nifty accounting that recognized\nthe next quarter’s sales a little early.\n\nAN OVERVIEW OF SENSORMATIC’S FICTITIOUS FINANCIAL\nREPORTING SCHEMES\n\nThe SEC found that Sensormatic misstated its quarterly revenue and earnings from\nat least the first quarter of fiscal year 1994 until the third quarter of fiscal year 1995.\"\nFurther, the SEC claimed that Sensormatic’s senior management, including Pardue and\nSimmons, were “aware of the methods used to effectuate the scheme, [and] also con-\ndoned and directed them. Others at various levels and in various departments also\nparticipated in these practices” (AAER 1017, 1998).\n\nAccording to the SEC, memoranda were prepared close to the end of each quarter,\nspecifying sales goals that needed to be met before the close of the quarter, in order\nto comply with the aggressive sales budgets that had been published and distributed\nto senior management and to the various departments. When it became clear that the\ncompany could not reach the budget targets, “Sensormatic engaged in a variety of\nimproper revenue recognition practices .. . that were not in conformity with Generally\nAccepted Accounting Principles (‘GAAP’) ...” (AAER 1017, 1998). Improper revenue\nrecognition refers to incorrectly recording a transaction in the financial statements, indi-\ncating that the conditions have been met for the earning of revenue.\n\nScheme #1: Holding Books Open after the Close of a Reporting Period\n\nThe SOX Report, which examined all the SEC Enforcement Actions for July 31, 1997,\nthrough July 30, 2003, found 25 enforcement actions in this period “involving the fail-\nure of issuers to close their books properly at the close of a reporting period” (2002,\np. 8). Simply put, holding books open enables a company to report the next quarter’s\nsales in the current period by simply keeping the current period’s books and records\nopen for a few extra days after the close of a reporting period to record additional sales.\nThis strategy was one of a “variety of improper revenue recognition practices” that\nSensormatic allegedly used.

The company system then\n\nfalsely recorded shipments as having occurred on the last day of the prior quarter\n(AAER 1017, 1998).\n\nScheme #2: False Recognition of Early Shipments\n\nThe next improper revenue recognition practice Sensormatic used to meet its quarterly\nsales budgets was the ploy of shipping goods that customers had ordered for the next\nperiod to Sensormatic’s own warehouses at the end of the current period. Then in the\nfinancial records, the company would recognize this revenue at the time of the shipment\nto its own warehouse. This scheme was so elaborate that the company needed to create\na set of what were known as “off-books” records in order to keep track of the prema-\nturely shipped goods to ensure that they were later shipped from the warehouses to the\ncustomers at the appropriate time, as originally requested by the customer. Sometimes\nthe goods remained in the warehouses for several months before they were shipped to\nthe customers.\n\nScheme #3: Slow Shipping Requests\n\nAnother tactic Sensormatic allegedly used to accelerate its revenue recognition was\nwhat is called “slow shipping,” or requesting the shipping company to delay the\nshipment of goods. When a customer ordered items for the next quarter, Sensormatic\nsometimes shipped the goods early in order to record the sale in the current quarter.\nHowever, according to the SEC, to avoid having the goods arrive at the customer before\nthe requested date, Sensormatic would instruct the carrier to delay the delivery for any-\nthing from a few days to a few weeks. Using this slow shipping strategy, the company\ncould record a few extra days’ sales in a particular quarter.\n\nScheme #4: Recognizing “FOB Destination” Sales at the Time of Shipment\n\nWhen a sales order stipulates “FOB destination,” it means that there is a sales agreement\nspecifying that ownership passes to the customer only when the purchased goods arrive\nat their destination. According to GAAP, the sale can be recognized only when the cus-\ntomer takes ownership. However, the SEC alleged that in the last week of some quarters,\nSensormatic recognized some of its FOB destination sales at the time of shipping instead\nof the time the goods reached their destination. This was yet another of the “variety of\nimproper revenue recognition practices” that the Commission alleged Sensormatic used\nin its attempt to meet analysts’ quarterly revenue and earnings expectations.\nTable 4.1 summarizes Sensormatic’s misstatements over a two-year period.\n\nScheme #5: Misleading the Auditors\n\nThe SEC also stated that Sensormatic carefully concealed its deceptive practices. Besides\nthe computer clock being stopped to backdate sales after the end of a period, documents\nwere also provided indicating that shipments to the company’s own warehouses were\n''"

Typically, Xerox customer leases generate rev-\nenue from three streams:\n\n1. The equipment revenue known at Xerox as the “box” revenue. This revenue is earned\nby making the physical asset (the copy machine itself) available to the customer, and\nit is legitimately recognized at the beginning of the lease in sales-type leases.\n\n2. Revenue for servicing the equipment. GAAP requires this revenue to be recog-\nnized over the life of the lease.\n\n3. The financing of revenue on the effective loans to the lessees. GAAP also requires\nthis revenue to be recognized over the life of the lease.\n\nThe SEC found that Xerox shifted revenue in the following ways:\n\n¢ Xerox shifted revenue from its servicing revenue stream to the box revenue stream,\nmaking it appear as revenue received for physically transferring the equipment to\nthe customer. This was done in order to recognize future service revenue at the\nbeginning of the lease. Xerox’s internal name for the accounting method whereby\nit shifted this revenue was its “return on equity” method.\n\n¢ Xerox also shifted certain portions of its financing revenue to the box or equip-\nment revenue stream so as to recognize that revenue at the beginning of the lease.\nXerox’s name for the accounting method under which it made this shift was the\n“margin normalization” system.\n\nAccording to the SEC, “These two methodologies, which did not comply with\nGAAP, increased Xerox’s equipment revenues by $2.8 billion and its pre-tax earnings\nby $660 million from 1997 to 2000.” The SEC complaint alleged that Xerox failed to\ndisclose its use of these methods, “which were changes in accounting methods and\nchanges in accounting estimates.” (Quotes from AAER 1542, 2002)\n\nScheme #2: Estimates of Discount Rates and Residual Values\n\nFurther, an article in The Accountant described an SEC complaint against the Xerox audi-\ntors, KPMG, as follows: “Between 1995 and 2000, Xerox always assumed a 15 percent\nreturn... despite significant volatility in the returns actually earned by leasing com-\npanies” (“SEC Complaint . . .,” 2003). Leasing companies discount future cash flows\nwhen they recognize the amounts in current income. (Discounted future cash flows\nrefer to the present value of the future cash that a company expects to receive or pay.)\nBy choosing a particular discount rate, a leasing company can manipulate its reported\n\n \n\n* KPMG consented to the entry of this order without admitting or denying the finding therein, except as to\nthe Commission’s jurisdiction over it and the subject matter of these proceedings.

(Note: KPMG strongly defended its\naudit work at Xerox.)\n\nScheme #3: Improper Disclosure of Sales of Leases\n\nXerox also sold approximately $400 million of its existing leases. This occurred after\nXerox Brazil changed its emphasis from sales-type leases to operating leases. This rev-\nenue from the operating leases would have been received over a number of years over\nthe durations of the leases. However, the sale of the receivables to a lender caused the\nrevenue to be recognized immediately and the cash to be received immediately. The\nnondisclosure of these sales had the dual effects of making the operating income in\nthe period of the sale look better than it was, as well as making the cash-flow situa-\ntion look stronger: “This added $182 million in pre-tax profits to Xerox’s 1999 results”\n(AAER 1542, 2002).\n\nOTHER MISSTATEMENTS The SEC also alleged that Xerox boosted its earnings by creat-\ning cookie-jar reserves” and then reversing those unneeded reserves back into profits\nin later periods. In addition, the company improperly disclosed the gain on a one-time\nevent with the result of boosting the appearance of extra profits from ordinary, recur-\nring operations.\n\nSIGNALS OF XEROX’S FICTITIOUS REPORTING SCHEMES\n\nThe first two signals listed next apply to all methods of overstating revenue. The next\ntwo signals apply to Xerox’s specific methods of overstating revenue.\n\nSIGNAL #1: INCREASE IN ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AS A PERCENTAGE OF SALES Examine\nthe accounts receivable-to-sales ratio as measured, for example, by DSO or by days’\nrevenues outstanding (DRO). When a company shifts revenue from a stream that\nshould be recognized in a later period in order to have it recognized in a current period,\nits revenues, operating income, and net income increase, but its cash received does not.\nInstead, the company’s accounts receivable increase.\n\nSIGNAL #2: CFFO FALLING BEHIND OPERATING INCOME OR NET INCOME When CFFO\ndecreases relative to operating income or net income, this is the prime signal of a\ncompany recognizing any form of profit ahead of time. CFFO refers to the amount of\ncash generated after expenses from the company’s main operating activities, such as\nsales, services rendered, or other operating activities. At Xerox, CFFO went from 26%\nof net income for 1996, to 33% for 1997. Then for 1998, the company actually gener-\nated a negative CFFO of $1,165 million compared to positive reported net income of\n$395 million. This dramatic lagging of CFFO behind net income should have been a\nmajor red flag, signaling that something was seriously amiss regarding Xerox’s reported\n\n° Recall that “cookie-jar” reserves refer to reserves created by overstating a future liability in one period\n\nto release it in a future period, thereby fictitiously implying that the company has less expense in the\nfuture period.\n''"

Suddenly, in 1999, CFFO turned around dramatically, to positive $1,224 million,\ncompared to net income of $1,424 million—a ratio of 86 percent.\n\nIt was later revealed that in 1999 Xerox had sold approximately $400 million of\nits accounts receivable. When a company sells its accounts receivable, this increases\nits reported CFFO. To test whether CFFO is lagging behind operating income or net\nincome, one must deduct the amount of sold accounts receivable from CFFO before\ncomparing CFFO to operating income or net income. After making this adjustment,\nanyone looking at the signal of CFFO lagging reported net income should have been\nsuspicious that Xerox was dramatically accelerating its reported income.

In\nsuch a case, as soon as information is released that a company has factored its accounts\nreceivable, one should realize that this, in itself, could be a signal that the company has\naccelerated its sales.

Another\nDelaware company, HFS Incorporated, controlled franchise brand names in the hotel,\nreal estate brokerage, and car rental industries. These two companies merged in\nDecember 1997, taking the name of Cendant Corporation, which carried on the com-\nbined activities of the two formerly separate companies.\n\nThe SEC maintained that the fraud began with the original CUC as far back as 1985\nand was allegedly directed by CUC’s chairman and CEO, Walter Forbes, from the very\nbeginning. The SEC’s complaint also alleged that CUC’s president and COO, E. Kirk\nShelton, joined Forbes in directing the scheme from at least 1991 onward (AAER 1372,\n2001; LR 16919, 2001). The Commission also contended that Cosmo Corigliano, who\nserved as controller of CUC from 1983 to 1995 and as CFO from 1995 to 1997, “assisted\nsenior CUC officers who initiated the long-running financial reporting fraud and later,\nas CUC’s Chief Financial Officer, proceeded to orchestrate and refine the fraud” (AAER\n2014, 2004; LR 18711, 2004).’ Referring to the CUC case, Richard Walker, SEC Director\nof Enforcement, noted that “large, complex, and long-running financial frauds often\noriginate at the highest levels of a company” (AAER 1372, 2001; LR 16919, 2001).\n\nAccording to SEC records, another pivotal individual involved in the execution\nof the schemes was Mary Sattler Polverari, a CPA who was hired by CUC in December\n1995 and became manager of financial reporting in 1997. The SEC maintained that\nPolverari carried out instructions that “included adjustments increasing revenue .. .\nand decreasing particular expense line items” (AAER 1275, 2000).®\n\nAN OVERVIEW OF CUC’S FICTITIOUS FINANCIAL REPORTING\nSCHEMES\n\nAccording to the Securities and Exchange Commission, beginning in at least 1985,\n“certain members of CUC’s senior management implemented a scheme designed to\nensure that CUC always met the financial results anticipated by Wall Street analysts. The\nCUC managers utilized a variety of means to achieve their goals” (AAER 1275, 2000).\n\nThe SOX Report (2002) found 80 enforcement matters in which companies reported\nfictitious revenue, and the report described several ways in which improper revenue\nrecognition involving fictitious revenue occurred: “The manipulation of revenue was\naccomplished through, among other means, the falsification of sales documents, side\nagreements with customers that were not recorded, and top-side adjustments by senior\nmanagement” (p. 11).\n\n \n\n° The fraud occurred at CUC before the company merged with Cendant.\n\n7 Cosmo Corigliano and others “consented to the entry of the Final Judgment without admitting or denying\nthe allegations of the complaint.” As set out in LR 18711, 2004.\n\n* Mary Sattler Polverari consented to the entry of the order without admitting or denying the findings.

              "value": "Chapter 4 * Hocus Pocus\n\nOne of CUC’s primary methods of fictitious revenue reporting was through the\nuse of top-side adjustments. In addition to the top-side entries, entries recorded in the\nfinancial statements but not in the general ledger or other formal accounting records,\nCUC also transferred some amounts for deferred club membership revenues to cur-\nrent periods’ revenues. Further, the company created huge overstated merger reserves,\nwhich it used as cookie-jar reserves to be released into profits in later periods. After\nthe merger of CUC with HFS, Inc., the newly established Cendant discovered the CUC\nfraud. In 1998, this represented the biggest accounting fraud ever revealed in the United\nStates. However, in the first decade of the 21st century, the CUC fraud was surpassed\nby several much larger accounting frauds. CUC is presented in this chapter as an exam-\nple of overstating revenue by the use of fictitious revenue. (Note that WorldCom is exam-\nined in this text as an illustration of the fraudulent use of merger acquisition reserves.)\n\nThe CUC Scheme of Reporting Fictitious Revenue via Top-Side\nAdjustments\n\nFor the hands-on part of the scheme that required actually making the top-side adjust-\nment (adjustments made in the financial statements and not in the general ledger), the\nalleged role of Polverari was important. She received the financial reports from all the\nbusiness units and compiled a monthly report showing the results of each unit. Each\nquarter she submitted the quarterly consolidated report to her supervisors. This was\nwhen the scheme started. Polverari’s supervisors would devise instructions describing\nadjustments for her to make: “Typically the instructions included adjustments increas-\ning revenue by a certain amount and decreasing particular expense line items by cer-\ntain amounts” (AAER 1275, 2000). Most of the alterations were concentrated on the\nComp-U-Card division. The adjustments always increased earnings, and they never\nhad supporting documentation. The SEC commented:\n\nThe adjustments were entirely top-side adjustments. That is, the adjustments\nwere simply entered into Polverari’s spreadsheet at Stamford—no journal\nentries were created, no entries were made to CUC’s general ledger, and the\nadjustments were not carried down to the books and records of Comp-U-Card\nor any of the company’s other divisions. (AAER 1275, 2000)\n\nClearly, the revenue recognized in this manner was entirely fictitious, with no\naccounting explanation provided for the entries. However, the explanation given\nto Polverari for the entries was amazingly frank. She was apparently informed that\n“CUC’s chief financial officer had generated the adjustments to inflate CUC’s quarterly\nresults so that the results would meet earnings expectations of Wall Street analysts.”\nPolverari was even told that some of the adjustments were made to achieve percentage\ntargets for some expenses and that some of the adjustments were “to ensure that items\nsuch as receivables and cash were at levels he [the CFO] thought desirable.” (Quotes\nfrom AAER 1275, 2000)\n\nThe Commission found that for the fiscal years ended January 31, 1996; January 31,\n1997; and December 31, 1997, the top-side alterations aggregated $31 million, $87 million,\nand $176 million, respectively. Because the top-side entries were not entered in the\ncompany’s general ledger, something had to be done to align retained earnings with the\n\n103\n''"

The SEC maintained that in April 1998, after the filing of\nCendant’s annual financial statements, “Polverari directed the subsidiaries to give the\nentries March 1998 effective dates and stated that the entries that ‘would normally be\ncharged to the P&L can be charged directly to Retained Earnings to avoid opening last\nyear’s books’” (AAER 1275, 2000). The Commission also found that in January 1998, man-\nagers ordered approximately $115 million in unsupported post-closing journal entries,\nreversing the company’s merger reserves. This dramatically inflated reported profits.\n(Refer to the WorldCom chapter of this text, Chapter 5, “WorldCom Wizardry: From\nWorldCom to WorldCon,” for a detailed analysis of improper use of merger reserves.)\n\nSIGNALS OF CUC’S SCHEME OF REPORTING FICTITIOUS REVENUE\n\nThe major signals for overstatement of revenues are the same as those discussed in\nthe analysis of Sunbeam’s accelerated revenue reporting. In addition, CUC manipu-\nlated membership subscriptions and suspiciously met analysts’ earnings targets on a\nregular basis.\n\nSIGNAL #1: INCREASE IN ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AS A PERCENTAGE OF SALES Once\nagain, accounts receivable as a percentage of sales as captured in such measures as DSO\nis a leading signal of this fraud. (Refer to Sunbeam’s signals in Chapter 3, “The Sizzling\nSaga of Sunbeam.”)\n\nSIGNAL #2: CFFO FALLS BEHIND OPERATING INCOME Also, CFFO lagging reported\noperating income or net income is a strong signal of a possible overstatement of rev-\nenue in the income statement. When examining financial statements, one must be con-\ncerned when the reported income is not being earned in cash.\n\nSIGNAL #3: DEFERRED REVENUE DECREASES AS A PERCENTAGE OF TOTAL REVENUES In\na company that sells membership subscriptions, deferred revenue decreasing as a per-\ncentage of total revenue is an indication that the company may be aggressively recog-\nnizing subscription revenues that will actually be earned only in future periods. This\nfalsely boosts current revenues and earnings at the expense of future periods.\n\nSIGNAL #4: PRECISELY MEETING ANALYSTS’ TARGETS Yet again, when a company\nprecisely meets analysts’ earnings and revenue expectations quarter after quarter, it is\noften a sign that things may be too good to be true. SEC enforcement actions frequently\ncomment on how companies in violation of reporting standards consistently met their\nown earnings targets.\n\nSIGNAL #5: FIXED COSTS REMAINING A CONSTANT PERCENTAGE OF SALES When major\nexpense items remain identical quarter after quarter as a percentage of revenues, it is\nfrequently a signal that the reported expenses and revenues are being manipulated. This\nis an especially strong alert when an expense contains a significant fixed-cost element.\nOne would expect a fixed-expense component to increase as a percentage of revenues\nwhen revenues decrease. Likewise, it would be expected that the fixed-cost component\nof an expense would decrease as a percentage of revenues when revenues increase.\n''"

Kirk Shelton Is Guilty,” 2005). On August 3, 2005, he was sen-\ntenced to ten years in prison and ordered to pay $3.27 billion to Cendant (Haigh,\n2005). He appealed the sentence but lost the appeal and was ordered to serve\nhis original ten-year sentence (Farrell, 2006). In addition, in June 2010, the SEC\nbarred Shelton from ever serving as an officer or a director of a public company\n(LR 21548, 2010).\n\nCosmo Corigliano, Anne Pember, and Casper Sabatino, three of Shelton’s\nco-conspirators, each pleaded guilty in federal courts under plea agreements in\nwhich “the three defendants admitted participating in the conspiracy and acting\nunder the instruction of their superiors” (“E.

Corigliano was sentenced to\nthree years of probation. In addition, his sentencing included six months of home\nconfinement, electronic monitoring, and a total of 300 hours of community ser-\nvice. Corigliano apologized and took full responsibility for his actions. “I realize\nit was very wrong,” Corigliano reportedly told the judge. “My one wish is I had\nclarity of mind” (Taub, 2007, Jan. 30).\n\nWalter Forbes, former CUC chairman and CEO, stood trial with Shelton. Forbes’s\ncase ended in a mistrial. A retrial began in October 2005 in Hartford, Connecticut\n(Mills & Voreacos, 2005). The retrial ended in February 2006, with the jury unable\nto reach a verdict and the judge declaring another mistrial (“Another Cendant\nHung Jury,” 2006). In early 2007, Mr. Forbes was finally sentenced to 12 years and\n7 months in federal prison. He was also ordered to pay Cendant and its investors\nover $3 billion in restitution (“Ex-Cendant Chairman... ,” 2007). While in jail,\nMr. Forbes sold his Canaan, Connecticut mansion in the fall of 2010 for a reported\n$7 million (Kershaw, 2010).\n\nMary Polverari settled with the SEC without admission or denial of illegal\nbehavior.

              "value": "106\n\nChapter 4 * Hocus Pocus\n\nTHE INSIGNIA SCHEME OF FAILING TO VALUE REVENUE CORRECTLY\n\nThe SOX Report (2002) listed Insignia Solutions PLC as an example of the failure to\nvalue revenue properly via providing inadequate allowances for returns. This means\nthat the amount the company had set aside in the income statement to allow for cus-\ntomer returns was insufficient. The SEC found that Insignia Solutions allegedly “over-\nstated its Revenue and Net Income... [and]... understated its allowance for returns”\nfor the first and second quarters of 1996.’ Insignia had a standard practice of recording\nan allowance for returns—in respect of inventory at resellers—that exceeded an esti-\nmated 45 days of sales: “In effect, Insignia subtracted this allowance from its gross rev-\nenue to arrive at revenue.” Therefore, if Insignia understated the amount of inventory\nheld by its resellers, this would cause it to understate its allowance for returns and over-\nstate its revenue. This was the method the company used for the improper valuation\nof its revenue. The Commission’s findings quoted Insignia’s own revenue recognition\npolicy as stating that revenue is “recognized upon shipment if no significant vendor\nobligations remain and if collection of the resulting receivables is deemed probable.”\n(Quotes from AAER 1133, 1999)\n\nIn December 1995, the sales manager effected a shipment of $1.2 million to a\nreseller. A side letter was signed, giving the reseller generous rights of return. According\nto the SEC release of May 1999, “After the shipment, the supervisors instructed a sub-\nordinate to ‘drop the zero’ or report only 10% of the inventory held by the reseller. . . .\nThis had the effect of decreasing Insignia’s allowance for product returns, thereby\nincreasing reported revenue” (AAER 1133, 1999).\n\nNo restatement was needed for this in 1995 because there was a large enough\nallowance for returns at that point. However, at the end of the first quarter of 1996,\nwhen most of the goods were still unsold, the Commission found this resulted in the\nrevenue being overstated by $1.1 million. Also, because the later return of the goods\ndue to obsolescence was concealed from the finance department, a replacement order\nwas recorded as a new sale. Further, in June 1996, a sale of $750,000 with a 60-day right\nof return was recognized without an allowance for returns.\n\nInsignia restated its financial statements for the first and second quarters of\n1996. It reported restated revenue of $13.1 million in the first quarter, compared to\n$14.7 million previously reported. For the second quarter, the company reported\nrestated revenue of $14.9 million, compared to $15.7 million previously reported.\n\nOn February 27, 1997, Insignia announced that it was restating its financial state-\nments for the first two quarters of 1996. Following this announcement, the company’s\nshares fell 35 percent, from $3.88 to $2.53, in one day.\n\nSIGNALS OF INSIGNIA’S FICTITIOUS REPORTING SCHEME\nOF FAILING TO VALUE REVENUE PROPERLY\n\nSince overstatement of revenue via failing to provide adequate allowances for returns\nleads to accounts receivable that do not get realized in the form of cash, the first two\nsignals that follow are the same as the major signals for the overstatements of revenue\n\n \n\n“Insignia consented to the order without admitting or denying the findings. As set out in AAER 1133, 1999.\n''"

If the next period’s sales have\nbeen accelerated into the current period or if the sales are completely fictitious,\nthe company will debit accounts receivable and credit sales, as for legitimate sales.\nHowever, whereas legitimate sales will be paid relatively soon by the customers and\nwill turn into cash, the next period’s sales will probably only be paid next period and\nwill remain on the balance sheet in the current period as accounts receivable instead of\nturning into cash.\n\nSIGNAL #2: CFFO FALLING BEHIND OPERATING INCOME The second signal of inap-\npropriately recorded sales is when CFFO lags, or falls behind, operating income or\nnet income.

(Refer to Chapter 2, “Ethics at Work,” for a description of the ethical frameworks.)\n\nb. Past SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt (1998) stated that numerous companies “operate in the\ngray area between legitimacy and outright fraud.” He also noted, “Integrity may be los-\ning out to illusion.” Keeping Levitt’s comments in mind, consider a situation in which a\ncompany’s financial statements comply with GAAP but nevertheless present a misleading\npicture of the company’s operating performance and its financial position. Is it unethical\nfor management to issue such financial statements? Should companies abide by the letter of\n\nthe law or the spirit of the law?

Peregrine Systems, Inc.,\nCivil Action No. 03 CV 1276 K (LAB) (S.D. Cal.) (June 30, 2003)\n\nSEC Charges Peregrine Systems, Inc. With Financial Fraud And Agrees To Partial Settlement\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission today sued San Diego-based software com-\npany Peregrine Systems, Inc., in the United States District Court for the Southern District\nof California, for a massive financial fraud at the company that spanned 11 fiscal quarters.\nSimultaneously with the filing of the complaint, the Commission submitted to the Court,\nfor its approval, a partial settlement with Peregrine.\n\nAccording to the Commission’s complaint, the purpose of the fraudulent scheme\nwas to inflate the company’s revenue and stock price. To achieve that end, Peregrine\nfiled materially incorrect financial statements with the Commission concerning the quar-\nter ended June 30, 1999, through the quarter ended December 31, 2001. In 2003 Peregrine\nrestated its financial results for those quarters. In its restatement, Peregrine reduced pre-\nviously reported revenue of $1.34 billion by $509 million, of which at least $259 million\nwas reversed because the underlying transactions lacked substance.\n\nThe complaint alleges that Peregrine improperly booked millions of dollars of\nrevenue for purported software license sales to resellers. These transactions were non-\nbinding sales of Peregrine software with the understanding—treflected in secret side\nagreements—that the resellers were not obligated to pay Peregrine. Those involved in\nthe scheme called this “parking” the transaction. Peregrine personnel parked transac-\ntions when Peregrine was unable to complete direct sales it was negotiating (or hoping to\nnegotiate) with end-users, but needed revenue to achieve its forecasts. Peregrine engaged\nin other deceptive practices to inflate the company’s revenue, including entering into\nreciprocal transactions in which Peregrine essentially paid for its customers’ purchases\nof Peregrine software. Peregrine routinely kept its books open after fiscal quarters ended,\nand improperly recorded as revenue, for the prior quarter, software transactions that\nwere not consummated until after quarter end. Certain Peregrine officers characterized\nthese transactions as having been completed on “the 37th of December.” Peregrine senior\nofficers, and sales and finance personnel knew, or were reckless in not knowing, that the\napplicable accounting rules prohibited revenue recognition on these and other transac-\ntions for which Peregrine booked revenue.\n\nThe complaint alleges that, by various means, certain Peregrine officers and\nemployees fraudulently concealed the revenue inflation scheme. When Peregrine\nbooked revenue for the non-binding reseller contracts, and the customers predictably\ndid not pay, receivables—some of them bogus—ballooned on Peregrine’s balance sheet.\n\n \n\n*Obtained from U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. www.sec.gov. Peregrine agreed to a partial\nsettlement without admitting or denying the findings.\n''"

              "value": "114 Chapter4 ¢ Hocus Pocus\n\nLarge aged accounts receivable were not being paid, an indication that Peregrine’s\nfinancial health was deteriorating. To make it appear to investors that Peregrine was\ncollecting its receivables more quickly than it was, a senior officer entered into financ-\ning arrangements with banks to exchange receivables for cash. Peregrine improperly\naccounted for these financing arrangements as sales of the receivables and removed\nthem from the company’s balance sheet. There were several problems with this. First,\nbecause Peregrine had given the banks recourse, and frequently paid or repurchased\nunpaid receivables from them, Peregrine should have accounted for the financing\narrangements as loans and left the receivables on its balance sheet. Second, some of\nthe “sold” receivables were not valid because the customers were not obligated to\npay Peregrine. Third, several of the “sold” invoices were fake. For example, in June\n2001, Peregrine’s senior treasury manager, with senior management’s approval and\nencouragement, created a false $19.59 million invoice and sold it to a bank. As a result,\nPeregrine’s financial statements and books and records overstated Peregrine’s cash\nflow from operations, and understated its accounts receivable.\n\nThe complaint also alleges that, as part of the cover up, Peregrine personnel wrote\noff millions of dollars in uncollectible—primarily sham—receivables, to acquisition-\nrelated accounts in Peregrine’s financial statements and books and records. These write-\noffs were improper because they had nothing to do with acquisitions, and because the\nPeregrine personnel who directed the write-offs knew, or were reckless in not knowing,\nthat certain written-off receivables should not have been recorded as revenue in the first\nplace. Peregrine misled investors by not including the write-offs in its pro forma operat-\ning results, and by making the write-offs appear on Peregrine’s income statement as one-\ntime charges rather than expenses from operations. Through its officers and employees,\nPeregrine knew that (a) a substantial portion of these receivables should not have been\nrecorded as revenue in the first place, (b) the receivables were not impaired by acqui-\nsitions, and (c) it was inappropriate to make it appear to the investing public that the\nwrite-offs related to non-recurring events.\n\nThe Commission’s complaint seeks to permanently enjoin Peregrine from violating\ncertain antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws (Section 17(a) of the Securities\nAct of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and\nExchange Act Rule 10b-5), and from violating certain reporting, books and records, and\ninternal controls provisions (Exchange Act Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B),\nand Exchange Act Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13a-13). The complaint also seeks disgorge-\nment of ill-gotten gains, prejudgment interest, and civil monetary penalties.\n\nPeregrine, without admitting or denying the allegations of the Commission’s com-\nplaint, has agreed (1) to be enjoined from violating the antifraud, reporting, books and\nrecords, and internal controls provisions of the federal securities laws, (2) to disclose\nthe current condition of its internal controls and financial reporting procedure, when a\nreorganization plan under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code becomes effective, (3) to\ncomply, on an accelerated basis, with the rules regarding management’s report on inter-\nnal controls, implementing Section 303 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, (4) to retain\nan Internal Auditor to ensure that Peregrine’s financial results are accurately reported in\nPeregrine’s public financial statements, (5) to appoint a Corporate Compliance Officer to\nperform an ongoing review of Peregrine’s corporate governance policies and practices,\nand (6) to commence a training and education program for its officers and employees,\n''"

Hudspeth added that it had been hard to explain to members of his\n4,000-person sales force why investors were told that WorldCom’s revenue was increas-\ning while the sales force knew that revenue was declining (Faber, 2003). A few years\nafter that television interview, several WorldCom officers were found guilty of fraud.\n\nThe Chief Wizard: Bernard Ebbers\n\nAt 6 feet 4 inches, Bernard J. Ebbers was a starter on the varsity basketball team at\nVictoria Composite High School in downtown Edmonton, Canada. He already had\nthe ambiguous traits of coming across either as painfully shy or as powerfully driven\nand charismatic. His basketball team won the city championship in his senior year. For\nBernie Ebbers and Brent Foster, best friends on the team, it looked as though that cham-\npionship was going to be the peak of their careers. For a few years after high school, both\nspun their wheels doing odd jobs such as delivering milk. Then their former high school\ncoach took Brent Foster on a trip to Seattle. While Foster waited for the coach in a bank,\nhe picked up a brochure lying on a desk in the lobby—a seemingly trivial, distracted act\nthat changed the course of so many lives. The brochure was, oddly, an advertisement\nfor Mississippi College in the town of Clinton. The charming pictures of the campus and\ntown looked enticing, and Foster decided that this was the fresh start that he needed.\n\nThe very traditional Mississippi College is the oldest Baptist college in America,\nand the town of Clinton is lined with tall, old oak trees interspersed with striking\nmagnolias. On a subsequent visit to Mississippi College, the deeply religious and con-\nservative young Foster had a good feeling about the college and the town, with its\nmany grand Victorian-era homes. The fact that Clinton’s city hall had been the site of\nGeneral Sherman’s headquarters during the siege of Jackson struck a chord with the\ncompetitive young Foster, who enrolled in the school. When Foster returned home to\nEdmonton for the summer, it was clear to his old high school pal, Bernard Ebbers, that\nFoster was back to his peak.\n\nBy the end of that summer, Bernard Ebbers joined Foster and his new wife on\ntheir honeymoon road trip back to Mississippi College. Even more devoutly Baptist\nthan Foster, Ebbers liked the school and the town of Clinton immensely and took to\nsouthern small-town life, finding the green openness a refreshing change from down-\ntown Edmonton. Ebbers joined the college basketball team and soon was awarded a\n''"

Before long, he too was back to his peak and growing in confi-\ndence every day, his earlier shyness now counteracted by a kind of arrogant swagger.\n\nEbbers’s basketball scholarship, however, ended after one year, when his Achilles\ntendon was torn by a broken bottle during a fight with some local thugs. To get by\nfinancially, he helped coach the junior varsity team. This led to a high school coaching\njob at nearby Hazelhurst after he graduated with a degree in physical education.\n\nA year later Ebbers went to work for a clothing manufacturer, where he remained\nfor five years, before buying a cheap, run-down hotel and restaurant in Columbia,\nMississippi. By this time, he was married to Linda Pigott, and they had three children:\nTreasure, Joy, and Faith. In 1977, he combined with a few friends and began an expan-\nsion that led to nine hotels by 1983. This was the year that a court order instigated the\nbreakup of AT&T into AT&T and seven local phone companies to allow more compe-\ntition in the long-distance telephone industry. “The divestiture forced AT&T to lease\nlong-distance phone lines at deeply discounted rates to small, regional companies who\ncould then resell the lines’ data-carrying capacity, or bandwidth, to small businesses”\n(Jeter, 2003, pp. 17, 18). That was the impetus for WorldCom. The actual inception of\nWorldCom occurred when Murray Waldron, a businessman from Tennessee, decided\nto get into the business of reselling long-distance phone service in country towns.\n\nEbbers—now living in Brookhaven, Mississippi, and running nine hotels—was\nintroduced to this business venture by David Singleton, a friend from Ebbers’s prayer\ngroup at the First Baptist Church in Brookhaven. Singleton invited Ebbers to a meeting\nabout starting a company to resell long-distance phone service. Ebbers was aware of the\ncourt-ordered breakup of AT&T and had heard of small companies that were taking\nadvantage of the leases that AT&T was forced to option out. He was ready to listen\nwhen he got the call from Singleton.\n\nWaldron, Singleton, and Ebbers met with Waldron’s friend, Bill Fields, in a coffee\nshop in Hattiesburg, Mississippi. It was September 1983. They had chosen Hattiesburg\nbecause it looked like a rural area’s hub town on the map and it didn’t have a long-\ndistance phone company. Legend has two competing stories about how the company’s\ninitial name was concocted. Either way, what both stories have in common is that the\nfirst meeting about starting a company to resell long-distance phone service was in a\ncoffee shop in Hattiesburg and that Waldron was present. One story is that the men at\nthe meeting asked their waitress to suggest a name for their new company. On a nap-\nkin, the waitress wrote the letters LDDC, for “Long Distance Discount Company.” The\ngroup at the meeting made one small change to “Long Distance Discount Services.” At\nthis point, LDDS, the company that was destined to evolve—with over 70 acquisitions—\ninto the infamous WorldCom, was born. (An acquisition occurs when one business\nentity issues stock or pays cash or other assets for the voting stock of another business\nentity. The acquired business continues operating as a separate entity.)\n\nCynics of corporate folklore say that the story of the napkin and the waitress is not\ncompletely accurate and that the meeting occurred without all four founders. However,\nit sounded better for company mythology if the arrogant, self-conscious, yet charis-\nmatic Bernie Ebbers and the other three founders were present at the site of this slice of\nAmericana being lived out on a cold night in an unpretentious but warm Hattiesburg\ncoffee shop. These men were about to embark on a wild roller-coaster ride with their\nnew company. Almost 20 years later, on July 21, 2002, that same company would\ndeclare one of the most spectacular bankruptcies in corporate history.\n''"

Even the board of directors abrogated its responsibility\nand ignored the outrageously unfocused growth of WorldCom with more than\n70 uncoordinated acquisitions of other companies. The failed checks and balances listed\nby Richard Thornburgh, WorldCom’s Bankruptcy Examiner, in his First Interim Report\n(2002), included failures by the following:\n\n¢ The internal control system\n\n¢ The audit committee\n\n¢ The compensation and stock-option committee\n\ne Arthur Andersen, WorldCom’s external auditors\n\n¢ WorldCom’s Internal Audit Department\n\n¢ The board of directors\n\ne The management\n\n¢ The investment banking company of Salomon Smith Barney (SSB)\n¢ The chief investment banker and analyst Jack Grubman\n\n¢ Members of WorldCom’s senior accounting staff\n\nFor many years, thousands of employees, customers, corporate investors, and private\nindividuals were hoodwinked by accounting manipulations of massive proportions.\nHow did WorldCom spin so out of control? Why did all the checks and balances\nfail? How did Arthur Andersen neglect to detect the massive and poorly hidden\nfrauds? Why did SSB’s analyst recommend the deteriorating company so highly?\nWhy did the directors allow the chaotic list of acquisitions and the colossal loans to\nBernie Ebbers?\n\nAfter the September meeting in the Hattiesburg coffee shop, Ebbers, Singleton,\nFields, and Waldron contacted friends and acquaintances. Together with an additional\nfive investors, the nine of them incorporated LDDS with about $600,000 capital. They\ndivided its 1,000 shares among themselves. On January 14, 1984, the first long-distance\ntelephone call was made on LDDS’s system. At this stage, LDDS basically leased band-\nwidth and resold it for long-distance telephone calls. The company’s switching\nequipment, which it had purchased for $450,000, was located in a small building\nopposite the University of Southern Mississippi. The first customer was a realty\ncompany, Floyd Franks & Associates, which was owned by Ole Miss’s former wide\nreceiver, Floyd Franks. With Franks’s recommendation, LDDS had 200 customers soon\nafter opening. Still, it had capacity for many more customers, and with fixed costs so\nhigh, it needed to expand its customer base. (Fixed cost refers to a category of a busi-\nness entity’s expenses that one would expect to remain constant for a range of volume\nof units produced or services rendered.)\n\nAlso, without a technical expert to optimize the configuration of the circuits, its\nline costs were very high. After the AT&T breakup, LDDS wasn’t the only company\nto get the idea of long-distance discounting. There were a number of start-ups, most of\nthem running at a loss, just like LDDS, which was losing about $20,000 a month in 1984.\nBy the end of that year, LDDS had gone into debt to the tune of over $1.5 million.\n''"

Between the market competition and the requirements of the\nPublic Utility Commission, the charges to customers were more or less set. However,\nthe cost of bandwidth depended on the volume. Larger volume led to lower costs\nper minute. Ebbers decided that he had to get more customers and bandwidth—and\nsell the bandwidth cheaper than the other small-town competitors. Most importantly,\nhe had to do this while the big boys such as MCI were focused elsewhere. Ebbers\ncraftily decided that the best way to increase customers and bandwidth—without\ngetting the attention of the big players—was to buy the smaller companies. His first\nacquisition was The Phone Company in Jackson, Tennessee, where Waldron had once\nworked briefly to get experience in the telephone business. After this, Ebbers and\nhis associates bought ReTel Communications, also in Tennessee. Next, in order to\nacquire a small telephone reseller in Arkansas, Ebbers convinced his colleagues to\ndo something they would do over and over and over again until WorldCom’s final\nbankruptcy—they issued shares in their company (LDDS) to get the cash to pay for\nthe acquisitions.\n\nMany folks around Brookhaven, Mississippi, became multimillionaires from the\nstocks they bought in LDDS in those early years. With these acquisitions, the com-\npany’s sales grew and the volume of reswitching equipment grew as well. With each\nacquisition, the new company’s revenue, assets, and profits were included with those\nof the original LDDS. Around that time, LDDS’s first two CPAs quit the company—\nostensibly because of “personality clashes.” Looking back, one has to wonder if there\nwere other reasons.\n\nBy now, Ebbers was a keen acquirer of companies and was growing into a fanati-\ncal one. He became convinced that it was time for LDDS to go public. He realized that\nif LDDS was listed on the stock exchange, it would be able to raise cash readily by\nissuing stock. Furthermore, instead of paying cash for additional acquisitions, LDDS\ncould pay for new companies simply by issuing LDDS shares to the shareholders of\nthose companies. As long as the publicly traded stock price of LDDS increased, there\nwould be no end to the number of acquisitions it could make. As long as LDDS publicly\nreported increasing profits and increasing sales in its financial statements, it could carry\non acquiring companies, and there would be no limit to the growth of its stock price. To\nEbbers, there was no doubt—LDDS had to go public.\n\nThere were two ways that LDDS could become a public company. It could make\na public offering, or it could acquire a publicly traded company, and in the process,\nLDDS would then become publicly listed and traded. It chose the latter approach. In\n1989, LDDS purchased the publicly listed Advantage Companies, Inc., of Atlanta. With\nthat purchase, LDDS became a public company.\n\nThe Assistant Wizard: Jack Grubman\n\nEbbers now had to interface with investors as well as public institutions. As a result,\nhe had his first fateful meeting with Jack Grubman, the SSB stock analyst. Ebbers and\nGrubman had an instant rapport. Both had colossal ambition-to-knowledge ratios—\nalways a dangerous set of attributes—and both were newly rich, having come from\nworking-class roots. Both possessed the need to impress.

Interestingly, both men also shared the need to be generous with money gained\ndubiously. Both were driven and troubled, yet charismatic. They formed a bond and\nsometimes drank beer and shot pool together.\n\nEbbers and Grubman would later go on to overestimate the demand for Internet\ntraffic capacity at that time. Neither of them had much of a clue about the technicali-\nties of either the Internet or Internet traffic or the workings of the telecom industry as a\nwhole (Jeter, 2003).\n\nThe Accounting Wizard: Scott Sullivan\n\nShortly after going public, LDDS swapped some of its new publicly traded stock for\nstock in Advanced Telecommunications Corp. (ATC). With this transaction, Ebbers\nand Grubman acquired another associate who seemed very different from them. Scott\nSullivan was a brilliant, quiet, reserved, and conservative young CPA who had previ-\nously audited for one of the Big Eight audit firms. Sullivan had moved to south Florida\nto become CFO of a telecommunications company. When Ebbers acquired ATC, he\nalso got Sullivan, who became vice president and assistant treasurer of LDDS. Sullivan\ncommuted from his home in Florida to a condo in Mississippi, where he seemed to be\nalmost obsessive about his job and often worked into the early hours of the morning.\nHe was just what Ebbers needed: a serious and seriously smart sidekick—the brains to\nBernie’s brawn. In spite of their differences (or perhaps because of them), Sullivan and\nEbbers got along extremely well, and Sullivan became “the real force” behind Ebbers’s\ndeals (Malik, 2003, p. 7).\n\nSullivan apparently liked the idea of acquisitions as much as Grubman and\nEbbers did—but for a different reason. Sullivan understood the potential of acquisitions\nto provide opportunities to manipulate the profits, or earnings, that a company reports\nin its financial statements. Of course, reported earnings drive share price, and a high\nshare price can, in turn, be used to finance more acquisitions to begin the whole cycle\nagain. Thornburgh, the WorldCom Bankruptcy Examiner would eventually explain,\n“WorldCom grew in large part because the value of its stock rose dramatically. Its stock\nwas the fuel that kept WorldCom’s acquisition engine running at a very high speed.\nWorldCom needed to keep its stock price at high levels to continue its phenomenal\ngrowth” (First Interim Report, 2002, p. 6).\n\nSullivan seemed to believe that a company didn’t need actual earnings to report\nprofits of a given amount. The Bankruptcy Examiner went on to observe, “WorldCom\nput extraordinary pressure on itself to meet the expectations of securities analysts. This\npressure created an environment in which reporting numbers that met these expecta-\ntions, no matter how these numbers were derived, apparently became more important\nthan accurate financial reporting” (First Interim Report, 2002, p. 7).\n\nTHE ACQUISITIONS SPREE\n\nThe three men who influenced WorldCom used the company for their own convoluted\nreasons. Ebbers wanted the company to grow as big as possible and as fast as possible,\nGrubman seemed to want a leadership role in the telecom-analyst sector, and Sullivan\nworked on producing high reported earnings and high stock prices.\n''"

The lease cost of lines\nwas high, and with ATC, Ebbers got a large supply of his own fiber-optic lines. With\nthese lines, LDDS could use the Internet to transmit not only data but also voice\nand video.\n\nAt the end of 1994, on the quest for more acquisitions, LDDS acquired IDB\nCommunications, Inc., a global satellite business that included IDB WorldCom—a\ncompany with a large international division. Possession of IDB WorldCom gave\nthe company an international platform in Eastern Europe and eventually gave LDDS\nits new name, WorldCom.\n\nStill high from that deal, Ebbers and Sullivan went on to acquire a company that had\nundergone a very interesting change to its core business. WilTel, previously Williams\nOil and Gas, had experienced a severe drop in demand for its gas and wondered what\nto do about the idle capacity in its gas pipelines. When the demand for fiber-optic lines\ngrew, it figured that it could save a great deal of money by simply threading fiber-\noptic lines through its existing but idle natural gas pipelines. LDDS acquired WilTel in\n1995 for $2.5 billion cash, gaining a cable network with over 11,000 miles of fiber-optic\ncable. After that gratifying deal, Sullivan was promoted to CFO, the name of LDDS\nwas formally changed to WorldCom, and the three cohorts were gearing up to rock the\nfinancial world.\n\nBy now, with all the acquisitions, too many companies had been added to the\ncollection without being properly integrated into a synergetic whole. There was little\nliaison between the companies, and much of the work was duplicated. Employees\nhad already started to mock WorldCom. They ridiculed the famous Michael Jordan/\nWorldCom “teamwork” commercial because the various WorldCom companies actu-\nally eschewed teamwork and despised each other.\n\nIn 1996, the Telecommunications Act was passed, allowing for more competition\nin the local telephone market. This gave WorldCom another boost, and the company\ngrew exponentially that year.\n\nEbbers’s ego also continued to grow. The folksy part of his personality became\nmore pronounced; he dressed and swaggered more and more like John Wayne.\nPeople who saw him only from afar—and he was very visible around Mississippi—\ncouldn’t get over what a down-to-earth billionaire he was, always in blue jeans\nand boots. He was also a big donor to a variety of civic causes and colleges all over\nMississippi. In addition, WorldCom was a boon to the state, providing employment\nto so many Mississippi College graduates that the college even structured courses\nspecifically for WorldCom’s needs. While folks from a distance saw Ebbers as a hero,\nsome of those closer to him were beginning to see him get meaner as he got bigger.\nAlthough he was down-to-earth around town, with his down-home clothes and his\nunpretentious truck, he was always on the prowl for companies. He also bought\nhuge ranches and other properties, as well as a 60-foot yacht that he appropriately\ncalled ACQUASITION.\n\nThe misspelled Acquasition fittingly described his ego as well as his only real busi-\nness strategy of collecting an increasingly out-of-focus conglomeration of companies.\nEbbers was a walking mass of contradictions: devoutly religious and a generous donor,\nyet bad-tempered and penny-pinching. He was controlling on minute details, yet had\nno macro plan or focus for all the acquisitions that he was pushing through manage-\nment and the board of directors at an unprecedented, frenzied pace.\n''"

The unrelenting pace of these acquisitions caused\nthe company to constantly redefine itself and its focus” (First Interim Report, 2002, p. 6).\n\nWorldCom continued to grow too fast and in too many directions. In 1996, the\ncompany set its sights on becoming a major Internet provider and turned its attention\nto UUNet, which was the leading Internet provider in the world at that time. UUNet\nhad been one of the first companies to offer e-mail and Internet access to individual\nusers. As the company began to attract a vast amount of investment money, John\nSidgmore, from General Electric, was appointed CEO. UUNet then began providing\nlarge businesses the means to transmit data via the Internet. Next, the company pro-\nvided hardware for Microsoft’s online service, MSN. UUNet had gone public in 1995,\nand its stock price had soared until competition from AT&T and MCI began to knock\ndown the price in 1996. As a result, Sidgmore led UUNet to accept a buyout offer from\nMFS Communications on August 12, 1996. About two weeks later, on August 26, 1996,\nWorldCom acquired MFS Communications, swapping WorldCom stock for MFS stock.\nThis was a $12 billion deal whereby WorldCom acquired UUNet at the same time. By\nthis time, UUNet had over 4 million dial-up ports for users to log on to the Internet.\n\nWith this acquisition, WorldCom had broadband and networks all over the world\nand had become a major provider of Internet access and data transmission. WorldCom’s\nstock price soared on the grounds of its reported profits combined with its vast Internet\ncapacity and the world’s belief in the projected astronomical growth in Internet traffic.\n\nThe Myth of Internet Growth\n\nEveryone accepted the enthusiastic claim that Internet traffic was “doubling every\n100 days.” The only problem was that this expectation of Internet growth was not\naccurate. Om Malik (2003) clarified the misconception in his book Broadbandits by say-\ning, “Think of ‘Internet traffic doubles every 100 days’ as an urban legend” (p. 13).\nCompared to demand at that time, there had been a massive overinvestment in fiber-\noptic lines and Internet backbone hardware; in fact, the investment anticipated at least\nten times the actual demand. Not only was the demand grossly overestimated, but all\nthe large companies, including WorldCom, Global Crossing, Qwest, AT&T, Enron, and\nSprint, were building and acquiring capacity to meet that fictitious demand. Each com-\npany was seemingly unconcerned about the fact that what each of them was doing was\nbeing done ten times over by their competitors.\n\nBroadbandits points out that Andrew Odlyzko and Kerry Coffman, two AT&T sci-\nentists, couldn’t believe that Internet traffic was doubling every 100 days, so they under-\ntook a research study to analyze its growth. In their paper “The Size and Growth of the\nInternet,” Odlyzko and Coffman “proved that the whole notion of Internet traffic was\ndoubling every 100 days was hogwash.” The actual growth rate of the Internet at that\ntime was about 70-150 percent per year. The researchers found that every reference to\nInternet traffic doubling every 100 days led back to Sidgmore and Ebbers at WorldCom.\nIn August 1997, Sidgmore had stated in an interview with Telecommunications Magazine,\n“We’re seeing growth at an unprecedented level. Our backbone doubles every\n3.7 months. ... So three years from now, we expect our network to be 1,000 times the\nsize it is today. There’s never been a technology model with such an extraordinary rate\nof growth like this before.” (Quotes from Malik, 2003, pp. 13-15)\n''"

However, to justify the\nacquisitions in Internet capacity, WorldCom had to insist that the demand for it was\ngrowing at an incredible speed. Grubman joined in spreading the hysteria about\nInternet traffic and broadband growth. With Sidgmore, Grubman, and Ebbers scream-\ning about capacity being the only limitation, nobody in the industry wanted to believe\nthe Odlyzko and Coffman study about the truth of Internet traffic growth. The rest of\nthe industry ignored the proverbial iceberg and chanted their mantra, “Internet traffic\nis doubling every 100 days,” as they swarmed across the nation and under the oceans,\ninstalling ten times more fiber-optic lines than was necessary at the time.\n\nEbbers and Sullivan continued their acquisition frenzy. They were perhaps driven\nby a quest for power as well as intense greed. They did not want to lose the value of all\nthe shares they held in WorldCom, and the pursuit of acquisitions was their method of\nhiding the fact that the motley group of companies that WorldCom had put together was\nnot nearly as profitable as they were reporting in their financial statements. Sullivan and\nEbbers had to have more acquisitions in order to maintain the mirage of soaring earn-\nings and stock value. They did it with smoke and mirrors—and accounting magic.\n\nMaking Accounting Magic with Acquisitions\n\nAcquisitions provide an easy vehicle for companies to employ accounting tricks\nto overstate earnings after the acquisition. (Acquisitions can also make a corporate\ngroup’s revenue appear to be growing when, in fact, the parent company and the\nacquired company may be stagnating.) The falsely overstated earnings, in turn, drive\nthe group’s stock price higher, and then the company can use its stock as currency for\nthe next acquisition, which can again be used to overstate profits after the acquisition\nperiod. The entire cycle can then be repeated again and again. In the First Interim Report\n(2002), the Bankruptcy Examiner described WorldCom’s efforts to overstate its profits:\n\nWe have found that as early as at least 1999, responding to the pressures on\nWorldCom’s earnings, management undertook a succession of measures designed\nto shore up the Company’s income statement. These measures deteriorated into a\nconcerted program of manipulation that gave rise to a smorgasbord of fraudulent\njournal entries and adjustments. (p. 105)\n\nWhen a company acquires another company, the parent company can use a number of\ntime periods to manipulate profits. For example, sometimes the parent company recog-\nnizes a big one-time expense or restructuring charge with respect to the acquired com-\npany in the period immediately after the acquisition. This expense ostensibly is to anticipate\nsome event in the future and to provide for it in the current period—that is, to set aside\ncurrent-period profit and create a reserve now for when the expense, or liability, mate-\nrializes in the future. Examples of situations for which reserves could be set up include\nthe following:\n\n¢ The parent or acquiring company anticipates that the realizable value of the\nacquired company’s assets is less than the assets’ value as stated on the balance\nsheet—in other words, the asset will have to be sold at a loss in the future.

Hence, a reserve is created for this probable, expected future loss.\n\n* It is “probable” that the company will have liabilities in the future for a situation for\nwhich the liability has not yet been recorded in the acquired company’s books—for\nexample, a liability for taxes or litigation or employee severance payments.\n\nOf course, all the previously mentioned reserves should only be created if it is prob-\nable that the unfavorable future condition actually will come to pass. Falsely creating\nsuch reserves for the future—when the unfavorable condition is not really probable—\nhas two advantages for the acquiring company. First, because the charge is described\nas a “one-time charge” in the period immediately after the acquisition, analysts may\nnot see the expense as recurring, meaning that they do not see it as indicative of the\nfuture—and the value of any financial instrument, such as a share certificate, is the\npresent value of its future income stream. So the current charge (expense) in the income\nstatement is often “discounted” by analysts and investors. In other words, it may be\nlargely ignored by the market because it was related to the previous management, and\nthe current thinking tends to be that the new owners are going to turn things around.\n\nThe second advantage of false reserves is the big payoff. As the future periods\napproach, when the earnings fail to meet the hyped expectations, the company has a\n“cookie jar” in the form of the reserves that it does not really need. It can then conve-\nniently discover that the reserve wasn’t required and release this surplus reserve back\ninto the earnings in the income statement for the new period. So when a reserve that\nwas created is reversed because it isn’t needed, it erroneously appears to be an increase\nin the earnings in the period into which it is released. Conversely, at the origin of the\nreserve, it overstates expenses and understates profits in an apparently nonrecurring\nmanner in the period in which it was first created. As the Bankruptcy Report pointed\nout, “It is the inappropriate release of these reserves that results in one form of earn-\nings management” (First Interim Report, 2002, p. 107). WorldCom got to the point that it\nneeded acquisition after acquisition in order to release false reserve after false reserve to\nprop up its earnings period after period.\n\nThere is another similar accounting trick that a company can employ to use acqui-\nsitions to present false earnings and a false balance sheet. In this ploy, the parent com-\npany, at the time of the acquisition, creates a purchase acquisition accounting reserve.\nAn unscrupulous company can overstate this reserve and manipulate future profits by\nreleasing the reserve in the future. To the extent that a company overstates the reserves,\nit overstates goodwill by a corresponding amount. (Goodwill refers to the excess of the\ncost of an acquired company over the fair value of its net assets.)\n\nThis would be done at the exact time of recording the purchase of the acquired\ncompany (as opposed to the period immediately following the acquisition). No expense\nneeds to be recorded.\n\nAlso at the time of the acquisition, the company can understate the fair value of\nthe assets it is acquiring by making it look as though it has paid a greater part of the\npurchase price for goodwill—and less for the acquired assets. To economists, economic\ngoodwill is an ability to earn future supernormal profits on its net assets. (Accountants,\non the other hand, while having the same concept in mind, have some cursory rules\nabout how to calculate and allocate a portion of the purchase price of an entity to good-\nwill.)

If the parent pays more than the net value\nfor the company, the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets is\nall allocated to goodwill. The advantage of ascribing part of the purchase price to good-\nwill instead of, say, to plant and machinery is that plant and machinery would have to\nbe amortized reasonably quickly over the estimated useful life of the asset. However,\nuntil 2001, goodwill had to be amortized over only 40 years, resulting in much smaller\namortization expenses during each period in the company’s income statement, and\ntherefore higher reported earnings. Since 2001, goodwill need not be amortized at all\nunless it becomes impaired. Also, overstating the amount of the purchase price attrib-\nuted to goodwill means a company can understate its assets and create false reserves to\nrelease back into earnings as previously described.\n\nA further, especially egregious version of this accounting sleight of hand is when,\nin the period after an acquisition, a company decides that the value of the assets acquired\nis less than originally calculated and then creates a reserve for this decrease in antic-\nipated, realizable value. However, instead of recognizing a charge (as discussed in\nthe first version of this trick), in this version, in the financial statements of the period\nimmediately following the acquisition, the other side of the entry is a false reevalu-\nation of the portion of the purchase price that is allocated to goodwill. This indicates\nthat the parent company has now decided that the net assets acquired were of less\nvalue than was originally estimated. Hence, this creates the need for a reserve for the\npurported potential for the anticipated loss to be realized on those assets, and a cor-\nresponding increase is made to the allocation of the amount of the purchase price that\nwas paid for goodwill.\n\nWorldCom focused on the use of acquisitions to overstate reserves at the point\nof acquisition or in the period soon after acquisition. This was achieved by either a\none-time charge (expense) in the income statement or an allocation of a portion of the\npurchase price to goodwill on acquisition. WorldCom would then reverse these cookie-\njar reserves in later periods by releasing them back into earnings (profits), when it con-\nveniently “discovered” that they were no longer needed because the projected negative\nevents were not materializing. As the Bankruptcy Examiner stated, “It is inappropriate\nto record reserves unless a risk is probable and estimable. ... WorldCom appears to\nhave violated this principle” (First Interim Report 2002, p. 106). Furthermore, the SEC\nfindings in its enforcement action against Sullivan alleged that “the false adjustments\nand entries, among other things, improperly reduced expenses by drawing down\ncertain reserves” (AAER 1966, 2004).\n\nWorldCom needed to continue recording unnecessary reserves. Ebbers and\nSullivan went after bigger and better acquisitions to create larger and larger false\nreserves, which would then be released into profits in future periods in order to prop\nup inadequate earnings. This helped to boost the stock price, which was then used for\nmore acquisitions—and so the Ponzi scheme’s engine kept running.\n\nBy 1997, WorldCom’s acquisition frenzy became quite manic. Ebbers and Sullivan\nbecame a duo on the path to mayhem. They went on from the MFS/UUNet acquisi-\ntion to acquire BLT Technologies, which supplied prepaid phone cards. Back in the\noffice, Ebbers installed Sullivan onto the board of directors, after unceremoniously giv-\ning another member the boot. The turmoil was not confined to Ebbers’s boardroom.\nUnconfirmed rumors had swirled for a while that Ebbers, the pious Sunday school\nteacher, had been having an affair.

Through it all, he managed to find time and energy\nto acquire ANS Communications from America Online.\n\nOne would think 1997 had been a busy enough year, but seemingly without taking\na breath, Ebbers and Sullivan set their sights on acquiring a company three times bigger\nthan their own—they decided to go after MCI.\n\nMCI Falls under the WorldCom Spell\n\nMCI got its start in 1963, when ex-General Electric employee John (Jack) Goeken\nformed a group to pursue an investment idea. Goeken had sold two-way radios for\ntruckers to stay in touch with dispatchers and, of course, to “rap” with each other.\nGoeken figured out that they should put some microwave towers between St. Louis\nand Chicago, on the famous Route 66, to support two-way radio communications and\nthen sell the radios—hence the name “Microwave Communications, Inc.” (MCI). This\nwas such an innovative idea that MCI immediately had to raise money to fight the\nlegal battles launched by AT&T and General Electric to shut it down. MCI recruited\nWilliam (Bill) McGowan, a Harvard law alumnus, to help raise money and fight for\nthe fledgling company. McGowan took over from Goeken as CEO in 1974. After\nAT&T’s breakup in 1984, MCI expanded astronomically under McGowan’s leader-\nship, developing a huge fiber-optic network that supported the long-distance phone\nservice that we all know. After McGowan’s gradual retreat from the company’s affairs\nfollowing heart surgery in 1987 and his retirement in 1991, the company lost some of\nits focus and discipline. MCI’s overhead grew disproportionately to its revenue as\nit made spectacular losses on its experiments with Internet business and its “Music-\nNow” service.\n\nIn 1996, British Telecom (BT) made an offer of $24 billion for MCI, and GTE also\nput in an offer. The British press generally convinced BT that it was paying too much for\nMCI so BT withdrew its first offer and later offered $19 billion. Jack Grubman, the tele-\ncom analyst, added to the hype, arguing that MCI was worth the inflated price. Lynne\nW. Jeter’s book Disconnected: Deceit and Betrayal at WorldCom (2003)maintained that BT\nneeded MCI for the American market, GTE needed MCI for the overseas market, and\nthe Baby Bells needed MCI for both the long-distance and overseas markets.\n\nIf WorldCom could snag MCI, it would thwart all these competitive efforts, and\nWorldCom would then be the only telecom company with a huge local service, while\nat the same time being the second-largest long-distance service in the United States.\nWorldCom already controlled half of all the domestic Internet traffic through UUNet\nand commanded a stunning investment in bandwidth through the IDB, WilTel, and\nMFS acquisitions. If WorldCom could pull MCI out of the hat, it would have revenues\nestimated at between $28 billion and $30 billion.\n\nIn the heated competition between WorldCom, GTE, and BT for MCI, WorldCom\nbegan with a bid of $30 billion and eventually purchased MCI for approximately\n$42 billion. Most of this was paid for with WorldCom stock. Because BT already owned\n20 percent of MCI, it had to be paid $7 billion in cash. WorldCom made this payment by\ntaking on billions of dollars of more debt. (Jeter, 2003)\n\nVirtually every U.S. business magazine, newspaper, and journal was impressed\nwith Ebbers and gushed that he was a brilliant entrepreneur. He was regarded as an\ningenious visionary and a farsighted genius. Everyone repeated the chant “Internet\n''"

Chapter5 * WorldCom Wizardry: From WorldCom to WorldCon\n\ntraffic is doubling every 100 days.” Ebbers had become the Midas of the business world,\nas everything he touched seemed to turn to gold.\n\nJack Grubman, of Salomon Brothers, did his part in spreading the WorldCom\nmyth. In 1997, he told Red Herring, “WorldCom is at the intersection of everything we\nlike—no carrier in the world can offer the integrated set of facilities that it does. The\ncompany has nothing to lose and everything to gain” (qtd. in Malik, 2003, p. 21). This\nwas, however, the opposite of what the European press was saying after WorldCom\noutbid BT. An editorial in Information Society Trends blamed the U.S. stock markets for\n“enabling a second-rank company such as WorldCom to become a global giant in a\nmatter of a few years” (qtd. in Jeter, 2003, p. 81).\n\nMeanwhile, the U.S. telecom industry was in denial. Because everyone had swal-\nlowed the fabrication that Internet traffic was doubling every 100 days, WorldCom’s\ncompetitors were building up massively expensive bandwidth and data networks.\nEbbers and his enchanted circle believed they had a vast capacity of a commodity that\nwas in short supply, whereas they actually had a commodity that was in oversupply.\nAlthough they claimed that WorldCom had amazing synergy with MCI and that the\nintegration of the companies was going well, in reality, the infighting festered and the\nunnecessary duplications were nothing short of ludicrous. While WorldCom reported\nskyrocketing earnings, behind the scenes, company management was raiding the\ncookie-jar reserves created on acquisitions in order to meet earnings’ expectations.\n\nWorldCom’s internal turmoil was so well hidden that in 1998, Sullivan made the\ncover of CFO Magazine when he was selected for an “Excellence Award” (McCafferty,\n1998). Ebbers (the CEO), Scott Sullivan (the CFO), and David Myers (the controller),\nas well as other members of WorldCom’s senior personnel, were the toast of the town;\nthey had almost everyone fooled.\n\nPROBLEMS AT WORLDCOM\n\nAfter the MCI merger (in which WorldCom acquired all of MCI’s stock), things started\nto spin out of control. However, WorldCom was undeterred. After acquiring a com-\npany more than three times its size, WorldCom went on, in 1998, to acquire Brooks\nFiber for $2.9 billion and then CompuServe for $1.2 billion of WorldCom stock. Wall\nStreet applauded, but back home the workforce was restless. For a start, the UUNet\nInternet employees believed that they were the “technocrats” and far superior to the\n“low-tech” MCI telephone operation proletariats. The MCI staff had already lost a great\ndeal of morale during the decline after McGowan’s departure. The lack of enthusiasm\nwas exacerbated by the superior attitudes of the Internet division. To add insult to\ninjury, WorldCom decided to do something about the cash flow problems it faced as a\nresult of all the debt it had incurred to pay for mergers, combined with the debt it had\ninherited from the merged companies. It decided to reduce MCI’s hefty overhead costs\nwith a dramatic cost-cutting program, including cutbacks such as no longer flying first\nclass and staying in expensive hotels on business trips.\n\nWhenever a customary company perk is withdrawn, it typically causes a nega-\ntive reaction. If this is combined with a merger after a hostile bid, together with one\ncompany feeling superior to another, feelings are hurt and morale usually plunges.\nIn fairness, Ebbers tried to get the entire WorldCom hodgepodge onto a shoestring\nbudget—except, of course, his own hundreds of millions of dollars of compensation,\n''"

Rumors of problems in the com-\npany began seeping into the media. It was starting to become clear that there was no\ncommunication between the different departments at WorldCom, resulting in wasteful\nduplication of resources. The problem became worse in 1998 when WorldCom acquired\nMCI and increased the number of departments selling the same products (Krim, 2002).\n\nIn addition, as a result of acquiring MCI, WorldCom had two billing systems.\nSome employees would even switch existing customers to the other system and get an\nextra commission for a “new” account. The famous whistleblower and internal audi-\ntor Cynthia Cooper reported in June 2001 that such switches of existing accounts pur-\nporting to be new ones had led to commissions being overpaid by close to $1,000,000.\nWorldCom, however, reported publicly that the practice had been limited to a small\nnumber of cases (Krim, 2002).\n\nThere was such confusion between the various merged companies that inefficiency\nset in and disorganization spilled over to every level. There was a great deal of double\nbilling as well as billing of customers for work that was not done. Also, outside contrac-\ntors were billed for work that had not been done, and sometimes friends of employees\nwere hired to do simple data entry work at exorbitant fees. Furthermore, because the\ndivisions were under pressure to meet sales growth targets and the sales staff wanted\ncommissions, sales often were made at below cost. A 2002 article in the Washington Post\nreported that sales staff sometimes signed such outrageous contracts with clients that\nthe company actually lost money. After all the acquisitions, most employees did not\nknow what inventory WorldCom carried. Sometimes items that WorldCom already\nhad in inventory would be sold to WorldCom by an outside supplier for a higher cost\nthan WorldCom had originally paid. By 2000, WorldCom had become an incompetent,\nunwieldy conglomeration of over 60 telecom companies. (Krim, 2002)\n\nIgnoring all of the turmoil, Ebbers turned his attention to insignificant and petty\nissues. In a subsequent CNBC interview, Robert Hudspeth, the former WorldCom vice\npresident, explained how—as WorldCom crumbled—Ebbers became obsessed with\nsmall and trivial details such as travel expenses, meals for employees, or smoking\nbreaks (Faber, 2003).\n\nWhile WorldCom reported immense earnings for 1999 and still greater growth\nin both revenues and profits for the first quarter of 2000, the bitter truth was that the\ncompany was already in dire trouble. Not only had operations become chaotic and con-\nfused with all the uncoordinated and incongruent companies, but the telecom industry\nitself was feeling the effects of having built capacity for an overestimated future growth\nprojection (Krim, 2002).\n\nWith growing losses, slowing revenue, and debt spiraling out of control, Sullivan\nknew the true peril the company was in, and he knew that one way WorldCom could\nprolong its fagade of profits—and prolong its existence—was to make yet another\ncolossal acquisition. This would give WorldCom an additional source of false reserves\nto reverse back into earnings. There were only two telecommunication companies left\nof such magnitude: Sprint and AT&T. So WorldCom went after Sprint.\n\nIn fairness, the acquisition of Sprint would have added an important wireless\npresence to WorldCom’s long-distance and Internet traffic capacity to complete its\nall-round telecommunications clout. On October 5, 1999, a $129 billion deal was made\nbetween WorldCom and Sprint for the purchase of Sprint. Most of the price was to\nbe paid by the issue of WorldCom shares that were trading at $43.53 on that date.\n''"

However, the deal still\nneeded approval from regulators at the FCC in the United States, and European regula-\ntors worried that the merged companies would control too much of the long-distance\nand Internet traffic markets. On June 27, 2000, the U.S. Department of Justice filed a suit\nto put a stop to the merger of the two telecom giants.\n\nWhat the world didn’t know was that WorldCom’s merger with Sprint was its\nlast hope for continuing its Ponzi-type scheme. By now, WorldCom was an ineffi-\ncient mess. It was a colossal, unmanageable charade, with $30 billion of debt, stalling\nrevenues, and spiraling costs. The end of the Sprint merger was, in effect, the end of\nWorldCom. The stock price began to fall and Sullivan reached desperation point in his\nattempts to portray the company as profitable in the financial statements. According to\nthe later Indictment against Sullivan and Buford Yates, WorldCom’s director of gen-\neral accounting, members of WorldCom’s accounting staff were instructed “to reduce\nWorldCom’s reported lines costs and thereby increase WorldCom’s reported earnings.”\nThe staff was told “to make journal entries crediting line cost expense accounts.” In\norder for these entries to balance on the general ledger, the staff was further instructed\n“to debit, in amounts corresponding to the line cost credits, various reserve accounts on\nWorldCom’s balance sheet, such as accrued line costs, deferred tax liability, and other\nlong-term liabilities.” After certain entries were booked in WorldCom’s general ledger,\nit had the “net effect of reducing line costs by approximately $828 million, and thereby\nincreasing WorldCom’s publicly reported earnings for the third quarter of 2000 by the\nsame amount.” (Quotes from United States of America v. Scott D. Sullivan, 2002)\n\nThen in the first quarter of 2001, in his desperation, Sullivan began a further ploy.\nHe directed the first of the now infamous and spectacular fraudulent transfers of line-\ncost expenses to asset accounts. (Of course, money spent on expenses goes into the\nincome statement and reduces profit. However, money spent on assets is recorded in\nthe balance sheet and does not reduce profits. Capital expenditure changes one asset,\ncash, into another asset.) But if Sullivan did not want to own up to the scheme that\nthe cycle of acquisitions had been paid for with overpriced WorldCom stock based on\noverstated earnings, what else could he do? He could embark on a series of magical\naccounting manipulations.\n\nThe Bankruptcy Examiner, Thornburgh, summed up the major accounting hoaxes\nthat Sullivan directed to falsify the financial statements:\n\nIt appears that once income could no longer be sufficiently enhanced by the release\nof reserves, Mr. Sullivan and certain other WorldCom personnel directed a series\nof adjustments to its line costs in successive reporting periods beginning with the\nfirst quarter of 2001. (First Interim Report, 2002, pp. 105, 106)\n\nAN OVERVIEW OF WORLDCOWM'S FICTITIOUS FINANCIAL\nREPORTING SCHEMES\n\nAt this stage, it is important to examine the two major schemes that WorldCom used to\noverstate its earnings:\n\n1. WorldCom artificially created unnecessary cookie-jar reserves, usually on the\nacquisition of companies or in the period following an acquisition, in order to\nreverse those reserves back into earnings in later periods. This was done to boost\n''"

WorldCom reclassified $3.8 billion of line-cost expenses as capital assets, thereby\npresenting those costs as assets on the balance sheet instead of as expenses in the\nincome statement, in order to falsely overstate the earnings that it reported.\n\nThese two schemes were perpetrated in an unscrupulous and brazen manner with a\ntotal disregard for veracity and accurate reporting.\n\nScheme #1: Improper Use of Merger Reserves\n\nWorldCom’s favored method of creating false reserves was on the acquisition of com-\npanies. All Sullivan and his cohorts had to do was acquire numerous companies and\npretend they were paying for large amounts of goodwill as they overstated the reserves\nand undervalued the assets. In future periods, they would just reverse those reserves\ninto profits as it was “discovered” that the reserves weren’t really needed. This gave the\nimpression of a financially healthy company.\n\nThe WorldCom Bankruptcy Examiner (Thornburgh) subsequently stated, “The\nmanipulation of reserve accounts comprises a prominent part of the story of the irreg-\nularities in the WorldCom financial statements” (First Interim Report, 2002, p. 106). He\nreviewed the appropriateness of the following seven reserves (First Interim Report,\n2002, p. 107):\n\ne Revenue reserves\n\ne Bad debt reserves\n\ne Tax reserves\n\n¢ Depreciation\n\n¢ Purchase acquisition account reserves\n¢ Legal reserves\n\ne Line-cost reserves\n\nApparently, Sullivan and his buddies had gone wild in understating the net value of\nassets of the companies they were acquiring and overstating liabilities while allocating\nlarge portions of the purchase price to “goodwill.” Their audacity can be seen in an\nextract of the Examiner’s schedule of the amounts allocated to goodwill, with respect\nto WorldCom’s major acquisitions. The size of the number is hard to believe; however,\nwhat follows is not a typographical error. By December 31, 2001, WorldCom showed\nan asset named “Goodwill” on its balance sheet in the amount of $50.5 billion. Of this,\n$49.8 billion of goodwill was comprised of payments for acquired companies in excess\nof the net value of the assets of those companies, after the cookie-jar reserves were\ncreated by writing down the value of the acquired assets or by anticipating liabilities.\nThe Bankruptcy Report provided the goodwill allocation schedule outlined in Table 5.1.\n\nIn its interim investigation in 2002, Ernst and Young estimated an impairment\nwrite-down of $15 billion to $20 billion of this goodwill. WorldCom later announced a\nwrite-off of approximately $50 billion of goodwill in its bankruptcy filing in 2002. The\nThird and Final Report (2004) on the WorldCom bankruptcy analyzed the inappropri-\nate release of reserves to overstate earnings in two categories: (1) the manipulation of\nline cost accruals to boost profits by reducing reported line costs and (2) the improper\nrelease of revenue and other reserves into profits to “close the gap” between earnings\ntargets predicted by Wall Street and actual earnings.\n''"

To diminish the amount of\nthe line costs, Sullivan and his crew simply released the line-cost reserves that they had\ncreated earlier and allocated the reversal to line-cost expenses. In accounting terminology,\nthey debited the reserve on the balance sheet and made a corresponding credit or reduc-\ntion to line-cost expense in the income statement. Because the dollar size of the debit was\nequal to the credit, everything still balanced and expenses went down while profits went\nup. Never mind that the expenses were now understated and the earnings were over-\nstated. Arthur Andersen never did press WorldCom for an explanation of these entries.\nThe auditors either passed or missed the adjustments listed in Table 5.2.\n\nThornburgh stated that for the $239 million entry, “The sole support for the entry\nconsisted of a post-it note bearing the notation ‘$239,000,000.’” At certain times, the\nreserves were released even though personnel had determined “that such reserves\nwere needed to ensure that the company had accrued the appropriate level of reserves\nin relation to its liabilities.” At other times, the releases were cookie-jar reserves that\nhad been kept for when costs needed to be reduced. About $3.3 billion of reserves was\nreleased to reduce line costs inappropriately. At the close of each quarter, Sullivan’s\noffice tapped any reserve necessary to boost reported profits to “close the gap” between\nWall Street expectations and actual earnings. Overall, the release of reserves accounted\nfor the overstatement of profit before tax of approximately $3.3 billion through the\nunderstatement of line costs. In addition, the Examiner's First Interim Report identified\nat least another $633 million in the release of reserves to satisfy Wall Street’s expecta-\ntions.

They merely\npulled the oldest financial fraud in the world: improper capitalization of expenses.\nThey recorded money spent on expenses as though it had been spent on acquiring\nassets—as though the money was spent on acquiring capital goods that held their value\ninto the following periods.\n\nThe Bankruptcy Examiner described the scam:\n\nThe Examiner understands that, beginning in the first quarter of 2001, Mr. Sullivan\ndirected that hundreds of millions of line-cost expenses be capitalized, subtract-\ning them from what otherwise would have been expenses against the company’s\nearnings for the successive quarter, and disguising most of those reductions by\ntransferring them as additions to the company’s fixed assets. (Third and Final\nReport, 2004, p. 278)\n\nThe entries, which were passed after the close of each quarter, amounted to $3.8 billion,\nmainly reducing line costs and overstating property, plant, and equipment (PPE) over\nthe period January 2001 to March 2002. Further, “The journal entries lacked any sup-\nporting documents or explanations” (Third and Final Report, 2004, p. 278). In addition,\nthe findings of the SEC alleged that over 2001 and 2002, WorldCom falsely portrayed\nits profitability:\n\nWorldCom did so by capitalizing (and deferring) rather than expensing (and\nimmediately recognizing) approximately $3.8 billion of its costs: the company\ntransferred these costs to capital accounts in violation of established generally\naccepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). These actions were intended to mis-\nlead investors and manipulate WorldCom’s earnings to keep them in line with\nestimates by Wall Street analysts. (AAER 1585, 2002)\n\nThe obvious question in the face of such a brazen and crude fraud is, where were the\nauditors? According to the Examiner, the auditors—Arthur Andersen—did not demand\ntotal and simultaneous access to all of WorldCom’s general ledger and journal entries.\nIn addition, WorldCom gave Arthur Andersen misleading special “MonRevs”; namely,\nmonthly revenue schedules that concealed the top-side journal-entry adjustments.\nThese adjustments were used for “closing any gaps between targeted and projected\nactual earnings.” They also spread the irregular amount over a number of months and\nover a number of asset accounts so that no one amount would stand out dramatically.\nWorldCom also transferred the false assets out of certain accounts into other accounts\naccording to when Arthur Andersen planned to review the financial records. “By\nengaging in this shell game, those responsible for the improper entries stayed several\nsteps ahead of Arthur Andersen in shielding these entries from the auditors.” (Quotes\nfrom Third and Final Report, 2004, pp. 276, 283)\n\nThe combination of Arthur Andersen’s restricted access to the accounting records\ntogether with the machinations by WorldCom to deceive the auditors led to Arthur\nAndersen’s being oblivious of these top-side transfers from expenses to assets.

(Third and Final\nReport, 2004, p. 279)\n\nHowever, whether Arthur Andersen should have conducted its audit in a more consci-\nentious manner that would have revealed irregular entries is another matter. It can be\nargued that WorldCom’s external auditors should not have accepted so many limita-\ntions on their access to the complete general ledger at a given time.\n\nAuditors need to demand necessary access, and if that demand is not met, they\nare obliged to give a disclaimer audit opinion or a qualified opinion on the finan-\ncial statements. There is not much point in auditing documents if the auditors are\nnot going to reconcile the audited documents with the financial statements that they\nmust approve. The whole point in auditing schedules is to test their support of the\nfinancial statements. If adjustments are made to the company’s documentation or\naccounts or to schedules after they have been audited via massive journal entries for\nthe preparation of the financial statements, it is futile to audit the underlying infor-\nmation in the first place.\n\nIn its discussion of the auditors, the Third and Final Bankruptcy Report (2004) alleged\nthat “the company has claims against Arthur Andersen due to its responsibility for the\nfailure to detect any aspect of the company’s accounting fraud” (p. 261).\n\nTHE COLLAPSE OF WIZARD WORLD\n\nLike most financial frauds, WorldCom’s problems began with relatively small steps\ndown the slippery slope. Those steps, however, soon escalated into a major avalanche.\n\nEbbers Loses Control\n\nIn addition to fraudulently misreporting its earnings and net assets, WorldCom per-\nsonnel also enabled Ebbers to raid the company of huge sums of money by granting\nor guaranteeing him loans that totaled over $400 million. Some of these loans were\nunethical in that they were made at very low interest rates. In addition, there was little\nchance that Ebbers could repay them. Further, Ebbers did not disclose his problematic\nfinancial position to the compensation committee until 2002, and even then his disclo-\nsures were misleading.\n\nWhen WorldCom was doing well in the 1990s, Ebbers began applying for bank\nloans on his own behalf or for his other business interests. The crucial point is that\nhe dragged WorldCom interests into his private activities by pledging his WorldCom\nstock to secure his personal bank loans. Caught between a genuine desire to engage in\nphilanthropy and a strong need to assuage an insatiable ego desperate for recognition,\nEbbers also pledged his WorldCom stock for loans on behalf of Mississippi College.\nAs these loans grew—and grow they did—significant amounts of Ebbers’s WorldCom\nstock were held as security—so much so, in fact, that Ebbers could argue that if he were\n''"

Astoundingly,\nEbbers had pledged or guaranteed hundreds of millions of dollars of WorldCom stock.\n\nThe kicker for WorldCom was that clauses in many of these loans required Ebbers\nto make repayments if WorldCom stock fell below specified levels, and that is exactly\nwhat the stock did. It fell from a high of $64.50 per share in June 1999 to $46.07 in mid-\nJuly 2000, after the Sprint merger was called off. To pay his enormous debts, Ebbers\nbegan borrowing large amounts from WorldCom. The Bankruptcy Examiner observed\nthat WorldCom’s compensation committee alleged it was Ebbers’s idea that WorldCom\nlend him money to avoid the sale of his WorldCom stock to repay his outside loans.\nEbbers, on the other hand, disputed this, claiming that the compensation committee had\nasked him to borrow money from WorldCom rather than sell his stock, which would\nput further downward pressure on the stock price. Ebbers’s version makes it appear\nthat accepting massive loans from WorldCom was a magnanimous favor he did for\nthe company; it was a gesture of all heart. The point, of course, is that if Ebbers had not\npledged vast quantities of company stock for personal loans and guarantees, neither he\nnor the WorldCom shares would have had to be rescued. It seemed to be lost on Ebbers\nthat his argument of helping WorldCom by taking the loans was merely tautological. In\nfact, he appeared to favor this kind of circular logic to rationalize his actions.\n\nThe first loan of $50 million was made to Ebbers by the WorldCom compensa-\ntion committee on September 6, 2000. In October, the committee authorized another\n$25 million guarantee with respect to Ebbers’s personal bank loans. In January 2001, the\nguarantee was increased to $100 million and then to the even more staggering amount\nof $150 million. (Ebbers eventually signed a note in September 2001 agreeing to repay\nthe amounts extended under the guarantees.)\n\nThe Global Crossing bankruptcy filing in January 2001 hit WorldCom’s stock hard,\nputting another nail in Ebbers’s coffin. That month the stock price fell below $10 per\nshare. Ebbers continued his desperate acquisition strategy and went after Intermedia to\nget control of Digex, an Internet company. The handling of this acquisition later caused\nspecial criticism by the Bankruptcy Examiner. Ebbers was accused of withholding infor-\nmation from WorldCom’s board of directors as well as misleading them. The board of\ndirectors was criticized for not performing due diligence before its approval of the acqui-\nsition. Ebbers’s acquisition price of over $6 billion for Intermedia in July 2001 was gener-\nally considered an overpayment. To make matters worse, WorldCom became embroiled\nin an expensive lawsuit with Digex shareholders. The stock price of WorldCom con-\ntinued to fall, and blame was increasingly aimed at the formerly untouchable Bernie\nEbbers. In spite of his increasing debacles, in January 2002, the compensation committee\nauthorized another $65 million loan to Ebbers. What were they thinking?\n\nThe Third and Final Report shows that by April 2, 2002, the loans and guarantees\nto Ebbers exceeded $379 million. On that date, in an agreement letter, WorldCom for-\nmally protected its interest in Ebbers’s WorldCom stock as security for his loans. A\ncouple of weeks later, on April 18, Ebbers pledged his other personal and business\ninterests as security. On April 29, all Ebbers’s loans and guarantees were consolidated\ninto one promissory note of $408.2 million—a staggering sum by any measure. The\nReport shows that of this amount, $198.7 million was to satisfy loans to Ebbers for\nother companies controlled by him, $36.5 million was for a letter of credit used to sup-\nport Mississippi College, $165 million was a personal loan to Ebbers, and $7.6 million\n''"

This, in a nutshell, is the story of an ego gone wild, of\nan insane spending spree, and of a compensation committee that acquiesced to the\nCEO’s wishes.\n\nThornburgh, the Bankruptcy Examiner, faults primarily Ebbers as well as two\nmembers of the compensation committee for the loan fiasco. However, because the\nremaining members of the board of directors “ratified compensation committee actions\nwith virtually no data and without inquiring about or questioning the low interest\nrates,” the Examiner believed that claims could be pursued against all of WorldCom’s\nformer directors (Third and Final Report, 2004, p. 18).\n\nOn March 7, 2002, the SEC finally and inevitably questioned WorldCom formally\non a wide range of items, including the loans to Ebbers, as well as the accounting for\nacquisitions. On April 3, 2002, WorldCom laid off 3,700 people. The stock price con-\ntinued to fall, and the pressure on Ebbers burst through his wall of resolve to stay in\ncharge. On April 9, 2002, Ebbers resigned as CEO of WorldCom and John Sidgmore\nwas appointed in his place. The compensation committee, again, did the unbelievable\nfor their (rather tarnished) golden-boy Ebbers. They presented him with a generous\nseverance package that included $1.5 million per year for life and use of the WorldCom\njet for 30 hours per year.\n\nThe End of the Sullivan Era\n\nBy this time, a storm was brewing that would uncover the massive accounting fraud of\nScott Sullivan and his cohorts. Business was declining; WorldCom had run out of acqui-\nsitions to falsify profits; the stock price was falling; Ebbers’s loans were eating cash; and\na number of suspicious events had caught the attention of WorldCom’s now famous\ninternal auditor, Cynthia Cooper.\n\nIn March 2002, John Stupka—of WorldCom’s wireless division—complained\nto Cooper that Sullivan was taking a reserve for doubtful debts from Stupka’s divi-\nsion to use elsewhere. Cooper noted this as suspicious, but not clearly illegal. She\nraised the issue with the Andersen auditors, who brushed her off. An Andersen\nspokesperson said that Stupka’s division did not need the reserve of $400 million.\nPulliam and Solomon (2002) later reported in the Wall Street Journal that Norton’s\nresponse galvanized Cooper’s determination to find out what was going on, and she\nassembled a team consisting of herself, Gene Morse, and Glyn Smith of the Internal\nAudit Department.\n\nCooper, having decided not to accept Andersen’s answer, reported it to Max\nBobbit, head of the audit committee, on March 6, 2002. Sullivan backed down on the\nissue of the reserve, but did not forget. Pulliam and Solomon reported that the next day\nSullivan tracked down Cooper at her hair salon and warned her not to interfere with\nStupka’s business again. One day later the SEC delivered a “Request for Information”\nconcerning its investigation into WorldCom. That gave Cooper a little more leeway\nto go beyond the Internal Audit Department’s narrow operational audit and into the\nrealm of a financial audit. In May, Sidgmore, the new CEO, appointed Cooper to head a\ncomplete investigation into WorldCom’s books.\n\nOn May 21, Glyn Smith, of the internal audit team, received an e-mail from\nMark Abide, who was in charge of the PPE records in Texas. Abide attached an article\nfrom the Fort Worth Weekly Online of May 16, 2002, about Kim Emigh, a WorldCom\n''"

This\ncaught the attention of the investigative team. The entire sham that was WorldCom\nmay have been set in play by Ebbers following his high school basketball teammate\nto Mississippi College, but it was about to be unraveled by a different kind of team\naltogether—a team of trustworthy internal auditors. Cooper, Morse, and Smith began\nto triple-team Sullivan. The team had already come across an item of $1.4 billion in\ncapital equipment that was suspicious. By that stage, the investigators were already\nsuspicious about almost $2 billion of unauthorized capital expenditure. (Pulliam &\nSolomon, 2002)\n\nThe team kept investigating, and on May 21, it found $500 million of unsupported\ncomputer expenses that were improperly classified as capital expenditure. Cooper\nbecame convinced that operating expenses were being fraudulently booked as capital\nassets when Myers tried to stop the inquiry. Undeterred but without full access to the\naccounting computer system, the internal audit team became creative and surreptitious\nin their search for the information they needed. Gene Morse contrived to be testing a\nnew software program in order to retrieve the journal entry source of items in the gen-\neral ledger. Initially, Morse downloaded so much data that he almost shut down the\nentire system. To avoid detection, he started working in the windowless audit library\neach day. He even started copying accounting information on CD-ROMs in case oth-\ners tried to remove the evidence by destroying the financial records. Sullivan became\nsuspicious and tried to find out what Morse was working on, but Morse deflected the\nquestions. (Pulliam & Solomon, 2002)\n\nOn June 11, Sullivan called the internal audit team into his office to ask what\nthey were working on. Among other items, Gene Smith casually mentioned the capital\nexpenditure audit, at which point Sullivan asked them to delay it a few months. They\nrefused and left. Cooper and Smith then informed Bobbit, the head of the audit com-\nmittee, of the $3.8 billion misallocation of operating expenses as assets. Bobbit advised\nthem to inform WorldCom's new auditors, KPMG, who had replaced Arthur Andersen\nafter the Enron debacle. (Interestingly, Bobbit did not mention the issue at a board of\ndirectors meeting the next day.) When KPMG asked Cooper to recheck her facts, she\nquestioned Betty Vinson (the director of management reporting) and Buford Yates\nabout the capital expenditure entries. Vinson said that she had been instructed to make\nthe entries but had not been given any explanations. Yates claimed that he did not know\nanything about them. Cooper and Smith then questioned David Myers, the controller,\nwho acknowledged that he had known about the incorrect accounting. According to\nthe Grand Jury Indictment:\n\nSULLIVAN, David F. Myers, and BUFORD YATES, JR.... agreed that it was no\nlonger possible to disguise WorldCom’s rising ratio of expenses to revenue by\nreducing various reserves on WorldCom’s general ledger. Therefore, the con-\nspirators discussed a scheme to hide WorldCom’s increasing expenses by caus-\ning substantial portions of WorldCom’s line costs to be transferred from current\nexpense accounts into capital expenditure accounts. This transfer would allow\nWorldCom to defer recognizing a substantial portion of its current operating\nexpenses, thereby allowing WorldCom to report higher earnings. (United States\nof America v. Scott D. Sullivan, 2002, par. 23)\n''"

Sullivan prepared a white paper to try\nto provide theoretical support for the transfers, but nobody bought his arguments.\n\nOn June 24, WorldCom stock fell to below $1 on the stock exchange. The next day\nWorldCom announced to the world that it had uncovered a massive fraud that had\noverstated profits by $3.8 billion over the last few years. That same day the CFO, Scott\nSullivan, and the controller, David Myers, were asked to resign. When WorldCom filed\nfor bankruptcy a month later, on July 21, 2002, it attained the record for the largest bank-\nruptcy in the United States at that time. (Today it stands as the third-largest bankruptcy\nin the United States, having been overtaken by Lehman Brothers—which holds the top\nspot—and Washington Mutual.)\n\nTHE GATEKEEPERS WHO FAILED WORLDCOM\n\nOver the years, the capitalization of expenses and manipulation of reserves had over-\nstated WorldCom’s profits by more than $9 billion:\n\nThe Commission’s Amended Complaint alleges that WorldCom misled investors\nfrom at least as early as 1999 through the first quarter of 2002, and further states\nthat the company has acknowledged that during that period, as a result of undis-\nclosed and improper accounting, WorldCom materially overstated the income it\nreported on its financial statements by approximately $9 billion. (AAER 1678, 2002)\n\nThis estimate of $9 billion would increase, after further investigation, to close to\n$11 billion.\n\nTwo of the main perpetrators, Sullivan and Myers, were arrested on August 1,\n2002, and charged with securities fraud, conspiracy to commit securities fraud, and\nfiling false statements with the SEC. On August 28, a further seven-count indictment\nwas filed against Sullivan, charging him with conspiracy to boost earnings by hid-\ning operating expenses. Sullivan pleaded guilty to three fraud-related counts. Myers\npleaded guilty and agreed to assist prosecutors with the case. The next month Buford\nYates, Betty Vinson, and Troy Normand pleaded guilty to charges of fraud, conspir-\nacy, and securities fraud. Ebbers was later arrested and subsequently convicted “on all\nnine counts that he helped mastermind an $11 billion accounting fraud at WorldCom”\n(Crawford, 2005).\n\nThe responsibility for the repugnant financial reporting failure does not rest solely\nwith the WorldCom management and staff who perpetrated the frauds or with Arthur\nAndersen, whose audits failed to detect the irregularities. As mentioned earlier, the\nBankruptcy Examiner showed how every single gatekeeping entity failed to perform its\nfunction effectively.\n\nConcerning Arthur Andersen, the Examiner’s Third and Final Report went further\nthan earlier reports and concluded that Arthur Andersen allegedly failed “to carry out\nthe kinds of substantive tests that were warranted by the risks.” Even though it was\n“significantly deceived,” Andersen lacked due “professional skepticism” (p. 20).\n\nTurning his attention to the board of directors, Thornburgh scrutinized the\nimpact of the “scant involvement” of the board in the massive acquisitions. As\npoor as this aspect of corporate governance was, Thornburgh conceded, “In the\n''"

Intermedia ... seemed truly questionable.”\nThis huge acquisition had been approved without apparent due diligence. The first\nIntermedia agreement, on September 1, 2000, was presented to the board of directors\nfor its approval without “meaningful or advance data,” and the directors “passively”\napproved the transaction. In the opinion of the Examiner, the board would probably\nhave approved this purchase even with better information. However, the price of\nIntermedia increased, and by the time of the amended merger contract in February\n2001, “a vigilant and properly informed Board would have rejected the merger.”\nSullivan and Ebbers, without authorization, finalized the revised merger agreement,\nand the Examiner concluded that the directors breached their “fiduciary duty of care\nin not learning all the circumstances concerning the merger amendment.” This Report\nalso apportioned blame (in varying degrees) to the former board of directors for the\nfiasco of over $400 million of loans and guarantees made by WorldCom on behalf of\nEbbers and to Ebbers, who “breached his duties of loyalty and good faith.” (Quotes\nfrom Third and Final Report, 2004, pp. 17-21)\n\nCertainly, WorldCom’s Internal Audit Department failed to properly carry out\nthe function that an internal audit division should fulfill and was rebuked for this by\nthe Bankruptcy Examiner. However, the department was set up with a flawed focus\nand was not truly independent. It did not have sufficient resources and was geared to\nperform operational audits only—not financial audits. Taking this into consideration,\nthe Examiner pointed out, “Given this focus on operational issues, it was a credit to the\npersonnel of the Internal Audit Department that they investigated the line cost capital-\nization issue in 2002” (First Interim Report, 2002, p. 7). The Third and Final Report of 2004\ndid not recommend that claims be pursued against the Internal Audit Department\nstaff. Similarly, although the audit committee of the board of directors was ineffective\nand the Examiner referred to “the mistaken deference” that this committee showed\nto senior financial management, Thornburgh did not recommend claims against the\naudit committee.\n\nWorldCom’s major investment bank, SSB, represented yet another major gate-\nkeeping failure. The Examiner claimed that Ebbers breached his fiduciary duties and\n“that SSB aided ... and abetted those breaches” (Third and Final Report, 2004, p. 17).\nThe Report maintained that in exchange for WorldCom’s investment banking business\nfrom Ebbers, SSB gave Ebbers preferential treatment in two significant ways. First, the\ninvestment bank allocated huge amounts of initial public offering (IPO) shares to him\nwhen it took other companies public; second, Salomon favored Ebbers by providing\nhim with unusual financial assistance.\n\nWhile the practice of investment bankers allocating some IPO shares to their best\nretail customers is a long established one, certain aspects of the distribution of these\nshares to Ebbers was strikingly unusual. First, when Salomon initially allotted IPO\nshares to Ebbers, besides not being one of its good customers, he was not a customer at\nall. Second, the size of the allocation to Ebbers was staggering—bigger than was given\nto any other individual customer and even bigger than the amounts offered to most\ninstitutional investors. Third, and most incriminating of all, soon after the first alloca-\ntion of valuable IPO shares to Ebbers by Salomon, Ebbers used Salomon as WorldCom’s\ninvestment banker for the first time.\n\nThe first IPO stock allotted to Ebbers was for Salomon’s IPO of McLeod, Inc.,\nbefore Ebbers was even a customer of the banking firm.

By a startling fluke, two\nmonths after the sale of his McLeod shares, Ebbers saw to it that WorldCom employed\nSSB as its investment bank when it merged with MFS Communications Company.\nCoincidence? The Examiner did not think so: “The evidence supports the conclusion\nthat Mr. Ebbers received his huge McLeod allocation, at least in part, because the large\nallocation made it more likely that Mr. Ebbers would award Salomon investment bank-\ning work” (Third and Final Report, 2004, pp. 14, 15). Salomon earned a fee of $7.5 million\nfrom its work on the WorldCom/MFS merger.\n\nOver the span of all WorldCom’s subsequent mergers, Salomon earned over\n$100 million in fees and Ebbers made over $12 million in gross profits on various IPO\nshares. The investment bankers attempted to justify the IPO shares, claiming that\nEbbers had been one of their best customers. The Examiner, however, rejected the argu-\nment on the grounds that Ebbers had not traded at all on his SSB account, except for his\nIPO shares.\n\nApart from favoring Ebbers with IPO shares, SSB also gave him another brand\nof preferential financial assistance when he could not buy any more shares because of\nthe margin calls with respect to his personal bank loans. The bankers requested their\naffiliate, Citibank, not to sell any of Ebbers’s stock that Citibank held as security for\nits $40 million loan to him. SSB also guaranteed Ebbers’s loan to Citibank. One week\nafter Ebbers resigned as CEO of WorldCom and had no more business to extend to\nthe banks, SSB sold—at a loss—the stock that had been held as security for his loan.\n\nThe following chart shows the interrelationship between Ebbers’s IPO allocations\nand SSB’s investment-banking work for WorldCom.\n\nSummary of Salomon’s IPO Allocations to Mr. Ebbers and Investment Banking Activity for\nWorldCom in 1996 and 1997°\n\ne June 10, 1996.

Grubman also touted WorldCom\nstock, attended some WorldCom board meetings, and echoed the absurd “demand for\nbroadband is doubling every 100 days” line. SSB earned $100 million in investment\nbanking fees as WorldCom’s stock skyrocketed (before it plunged). Grubman stead-\nfastly refused to give the stock a “sell” rating. In his analysis of Ebbers’s relationship\nwith SSB, the Bankruptcy Examiner stated:\n\nThe Examiner believes that Mr. Ebbers breached his fiduciary duties of loyalty\nand good faith by putting his personal interest ahead of those of the Company.\nThe Examiner also believes that SSB aided and abetted those breaches. . . . Indeed,\nSSB is jointly and severally liable along with Mr. Ebbers for these breaches, The\nrecoveries could include ... disgorgement for the fees WorldCom paid to SSB.\n(Third and Final Bankruptcy Report, 2004, p. 17)\n\nSo it was that all of the institutional gatekeepers failed in their corporate gatekeeping\nduties.\n\nSIGNALS OF THE WORLDCOM FRAUD\n\nWorldCom overstated its earnings in two major ways. The first was its improper use\nof acquisition or merger reserves, and the second was the capitalizing of its line-cost\nexpense.\n\nSignals of WorldCom’s Fictitious Reporting Scheme #1—Improper Use of\nAcquisition or Merger Reserves\n\nUsing business combinations to overstate earnings leaves a number of signals in finan-\ncial statements. Let us examine a few of these signals.\n\nSIGNAL #1: PARENT COMPANY ALLOCATES LARGE AMOUNTS TO GOODWILL WHEN\nACQUIRING OTHER COMPANIES The prospective investor should be on the lookout for\nlarge amounts allocated to goodwill on the acquisition of other companies. This is an\nindication that false cookie-jar reserves may have been created and released back into\nearnings to falsely boost post-acquisition profits.\n\nAs reported earlier in this chapter, WorldCom had $49.8 billion of goodwill\nrecorded as amounts paid in excess of net asset values on acquisitions. (The net asset\nvalue of a business refers to the net amount of the fair value of a business entity’s assets\nless the value of its liabilities and reserves.) Of this colossal amount, $28.2 billion was\nrelated to its acquisition of MCI. In subsequent restatements of WorldCom’s financial\nstatements, and in its bankruptcy accounts, virtually all of the $49.8 billion was written\noff as valueless. Whenever goodwill, as a factor of earnings, increases dramatically over\ntime with consecutive acquisitions, it is a sign to be very skeptical about a company’s\nfinancial statements. Also, when goodwill increases over time with consecutive acquisi-\ntions as a percentage of total assets, one should be on the alert.\n''"

The parent company may even want to avoid taking a\nlarge one-time charge in its income statement to acquire the cookie-jar reserves. In such\na case, the company may reopen the value placed on goodwill at acquisition by creating\nfalse reserves in a later period and increasing the goodwill paid for an acquisition by\na complementary amount. These later adjustments increasing goodwill are a huge red\nflag that false reserves are being created to boost later profits.\n\nSignals of WorldCom’s Fictitious Reporting Scheme #2—Understating\nExpenses via Improper Capitalization of Expenses\n\nThis fraud overstates earnings reported on the income statement and inflates assets\non the balance sheet. In addition, this fraud overstates the cash flow from operations\n(CFFO) and inflates the amount reported as “cash used in investing activities” in the\nstatement of cash flows.\n\nWorldCom, of course, fraudulently reallocated billions of dollars out of its line-\ncost expense into the asset designated as PPE.\n\nSIGNAL #1: DECREASE IN RATIO OF SALES TO ASSETS The first signal of this kind of\nfraud is often a decrease in the ratio of sales to assets (i.e., the asset-turnover ratio),\nwhich is the ratio of a business entity’s total sales to the total amount that it has invested\nin all of its assets).\n\nUltimately, the reason that a company invests in assets is to generate revenue with\nthose assets. Obviously, a fictitious asset cannot produce revenue. Because PPE is one\nof the most common assets chosen for fraudulent companies to misclassify expenses, a\nfrequently used way to identify this fraud is to check the ratio of sales to PPE.\n''"

In the second quarter of 2000, revenue was 59.2 percent of\nPPE, and it fell steadily to 44.1 percent by the second quarter of 2001. Then as WorldCom\nincreased its fraudulent transfers from line costs to PPE, revenue as a percentage of PPE\ndropped precipitously to only 35.6 percent in the fourth quarter of 2001 and to just\n32.2 percent in the first quarter of 2002.\n\nSIGNAL #2: INCREASE IN PPE WITH DECREASE IN REVENUE When the PPE amount on\nthe balance sheet increases while revenue actually decreases, this is a double red flag\nthat something is likely to be seriously wrong with the company. The sales-to-PPE ratio\nis the ratio of a business entity’s sales to the amount it has invested in PPE. This signal\nis, of course, based on the same logic and dynamics as Signal #1, but it is a more pro-\nnounced signal and very easy to spot. Without even calculating a percentage, the pro-\nspective investor reading the financial statements can simply check to see that revenue\ndoes not decrease over time while the amount reportedly invested in PPE increases.\n\nFrom an examination of Table 5.4, we see that for WorldCom, the amount of\ndollars reportedly invested in PPE grew steadily from $17.2 billion in the second\nquarter of 2000 to $20.2 billion in the second quarter of 2001 and jumped to\n$25.2 billion in the first quarter of 2002, at the height of the fraud. Over that same\ntime, revenues dropped from $10.2 billion to $8.9 billion to $8.1 billion.\n\nThe logic behind this signal, of course, is that companies invest their cash in\nPPE to increase their capacity to produce goods and services and earn revenue with\nthese goods and services. A company cannot continue for an extended period of time\nby increasing its cash spent on production capacity while reducing the revenue it gets\nfrom that capacity. If such a trend continues over time, at least one of two things has hap-\npened—and they are both bad. Either the company is falsely reporting some of its cash\nspent on operating expenses as cash invested in PPE or it is reporting honestly and its\nbusiness model has serious problems. In the latter case, the investment in PPE assets\nis not producing the revenue for which the investment was made in the first place. In\nthe absence of clearly understandable explanations in the Management Discussion and\nAnalysis (MD&A) section of the company’s annual report or in coherent press releases,\n''"

However, fixed costs, by definition, do not respond to changes in scale of\noperation; hence, the fixed cost becomes a greater percentage of the shrinking sales rev-\nenue amount. (For example, if a company produces and sells less, the landlord charges\nthe same amount of factory rent; so the rent expense becomes a greater percentage of\nthe sales revenue amount.)\n\nIn the case of WorldCom, the line cost was a very significant expense that had\na fixed-cost element as well as a variable-cost element. Looking at Table 5.4, you can\nsee that revenue declined from $10.2 billion in the second quarter of 2000, to $8.9\nbillion in the second quarter of 2001, and to $8.1 billion in the first quarter of 2002.\nHowever, in Table 5.3, we see that the “line-cost” expense remained amazingly close\nto 41 percent throughout the period. It would have looked very suspicious if so much\nhad been reallocated out of line costs that the expense actually declined as a percent-\nage of sales. Nobody checked to see why this expense with a fixed-cost element had\nremained a suspiciously constant percentage as sales revenue declined. We now know\nthat WorldCom was calculating how much it needed to reduce expenses to hit profit\ntargets. If necessary, the company would understate line costs down to the constant\namount of close to 41 percent of sales revenue each quarter.\n\nIn fact, whenever any expense fluctuates too wildly as a percentage of sales or stays\nat a constant percentage of sales quarter after quarter, it is cause for suspicion. When the\nexpense that stays constant to within a percentage of sales has a fixed-cost component,\nit becomes more likely that part of the expense is being recorded as an asset. When,\nin addition, the assets are growing at a faster rate than sales, some expenses probably\nare being reported as assets. The signals combine to create a siren when, simultane-\nously, assets (such as PPE at WorldCom) grow while sales actually decline and expenses\n(such as line costs at WorldCom) hold constant or decline as a percentage of sales. At\nWorldCom, these signals indicated that the line-cost expense was being misallocated as\nthe asset PPE.\n\nSIGNAL #4: NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS REVEAL CAPITALIZING OF COSTS THAT\nARE USUALLY EXPENSED A fourth signal of misclassifying expenses as assets occurs\nwhen the notes to the financial statements indicate that the company is capitalizing\ncosts that other companies—in the same industry—expense. One can browse through\na company’s accounting policy note to look for such evidence. Although WorldCom's\nnote did not reveal much, often the note will indicate that the company is capitalizing\nquestionable costs. In general (although not in the case of WorldCom), these kinds of\naggressive capitalizations of expenses occur in the areas of:\n\n¢ direct response advertising costs.\n\n* customer acquisition costs and subscriber acquisition costs.\n\n* software development costs.\n\n* capitalized interest costs (which occur when interest is incurred on amounts invested\nin assets under construction). The interest must relate to the period beginning with\nconstruction costs and ending when the asset is complete and ready for service.\n\nSIGNAL #5: CHANGE IN ACCOUNTING POLICY TO BEGIN CAPITALIZING A COST If acom-\npany changes its accounting policy to begin capitalizing a cost as an asset that was\npreviously classified as an expense, it should alert the reader to the possibility of an\n''"

Investors should be warned to use all the signals in this\nchapter to test whether an expense has been misclassified as an asset.\n\nSIGNAL #6: WRITING OFF PREVIOUSLY CAPITALIZED COSTS If in the past the company\nhad a special charge in the income statement for writing off a previously capitalized\ncost, this is a signal that the company could be aggressive in its approach to the classifi-\ncation of items as assets rather than expenses. (In 1989, Cendant Corporation had writ-\nten off previously capitalized membership acquisition costs long before the company’s\nspectacular problems in 1997. In 1999, American Software had to write off previously\ncapitalized software costs.)\n\nIt is important to note that for this particular fraud of misallocating expenses as\nfixed assets, CFFO lagging operating income is usually not as helpful as it is in uncover-\ning other frauds. The reason is that in the statement of cash flows, the fraud simultane-\nously overstates CFFO and the amount of cash used in investing activities. Therefore,\nthis fraud makes it look as though the company did generate cash in its operating activ-\nities, but that it spent that cash on investing in fixed assets such as PPE. Thus, we must\nrely more on the previously mentioned signals for this scam.\n\nARE THEY LIVING HAPPILY EVER AFTER?\n\n¢ Bernard Ebbers, former WorldCom CEO, was convicted of securities fraud, con-\nspiracy to commit securities fraud, and false filings on March 17, 2005. He was\nsentenced to 25 years in prison. After a failed appeal, he entered the Oakdale\nFederal Correctional Institution in Louisiana in 2006. His wife, Kristie, filed\nfor divorce in 2008. Ebbers is scheduled to be released from prison in July 2028\n(“Ebbers’ wife files .. . ,” 2008).\n\nJack Grubman, analyst and crony of Bernie Ebbers,” accepted a lifetime ban from\nthe securities industry and paid a $15 million fine” (Guyon, 2005). Grubman was\nnever charged with any criminal misconduct relating to WorldCom.\n\nDavid Myers, former WorldCom controller, pleaded guilty to one count\nof conspiracy to commit securities fraud. In August 2005, he was sentenced\nto one year plus one day in prison (Bureau of Prisons, 2005; “WorldCom\nEx-Controller...,” 2005).\n\nScott Sullivan, former WorldCom CFO, pleaded guilty to three fraud-related\ncounts on March 2, 2004. He was the chief witness for the prosecution in the\ntrial of Bernard Ebbers. Sullivan reportedly admitted “that he repeatedly lied\nto the board about the company’s financial plight and its fraudulent accounting\nmaneuvers” (“WorldCom’s Finance Chief ...,” 2005). Sullivan was sentenced to\nfive years in prison, with his sentence commencing in November 2005 (“Sullivan\nGets Five Years ...,” 2005). In 2009, after receiving one year off his sentence for\ngood behavior, Sullivan was released from prison and moved back to Boca Raton,\nFlorida. He did not move into “the $15 million dream house he was building in\nthe exclusive Le Lac enclave west of the city. Instead, he’s back at the modest\nWoodbury neighborhood home he bought for $170,000 in 1990” (Clough, 2009).\nBetty Vinson, accounting executive, pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to\ncommit securities fraud and one count of securities fraud.

              "value": "156 Chapter5 * WorldCom Wizardry: From WorldCom to WorldCon\n\nThe Commission’s complaint alleges that Tyco inflated its operating income by at\nleast $500 million as a result of improper accounting practices related to some of the\nmany acquisitions that Tyco engaged in during that time. Tyco’s improper acquisition\naccounting included undervaluing acquired assets, overvaluing acquired liabilities, and\nmisusing accounting rules concerning the establishment and utilization of purchase\naccounting reserves. The complaint further alleges that, apart from its acquisition activi-\nties, Tyco improperly established and used various kinds of reserves to make adjust-\nments at the end of reporting periods to enhance and smooth its publicly reported results\nand to meet earnings forecasts.\n\nThe complaint alleges that Tyco inflated its operating income by $567 million from\nits fiscal year 1998 through its fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2002, by means of con-\nnection fees that Tyco’s ADT Security Services, Inc. subsidiary charged to dealers from\nwhom it purchased security monitoring contracts. Because the connection fee was fully\noffset by a simultaneous increase in the purchase price ADT allocated to the dealers’\nsecurity monitoring contracts, the connection fee transaction lacked economic substance\nand should not have been recorded in Tyco’s income statement. In 2003, Tyco restated its\noperating income and cash flow relating to the connection fees.\n\nThe complaint further alleges that, from September 1996 through early 2002, Tyco\nfailed to disclose in its proxy statements and annual reports certain executive com-\npensation, executive indebtedness, and related party transactions of its former senior\nmanagement. Tyco also incorrectly accounted for certain executive bonuses it paid in\nits fiscal years 2000 and 2001, thereby excluding from its operating expenses the costs\nassociated with those bonuses. Finally, the complaint alleges that Tyco violated the anti-\nbribery provisions of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act when employees or agents of its\nEarth Tech Brasil Ltda. subsidiary made payments to Brazilian officials for the purpose\nof obtaining or retaining business for Tyco.\n\nBetween 1996 and 2002, as a result of these various practices, Tyco made false and\nmisleading statements or omissions in its filings with the Commission and its public\nstatements to investors and analysts.\n\nWithout admitting or denying the allegations in the Commission’s complaint,\nTyco has consented to the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining it from vio-\nlating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Sections 10(b), 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), 13(b)\n(2)(B), 14(a), and 30A(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Exchange Act Rules\n10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-13, 13b2-1, and 14a-9. The proposed final judgment also orders\nTyco to pay $1 in disgorgement and a $50 million civil penalty.\n\nThe Commission’s investigation is continuing with respect to individuals. The\nCommission acknowledges the assistance and cooperation of the Manhattan District\nAttorney and the New York City Police Department.\n''"

Understating acquired assets benefited Tyco’s earnings by decreasing deprecia-\ntion expense in future periods for long-lived assets and, for current assets, by allowing\nTyco to record larger profits as the assets were utilized. Overstating acquired liabilities\nallowed Tyco to maintain on its books and records inflated reserves, which Tyco used in\nfuture periods to improve its earnings.\n\n17. In certain acquisitions made in 1996, Tyco officials convinced the companies\nthat were being acquired to make entries to their books and records that understated the\nassets and overstated the liabilities that Tyco would acquire. For example, at the urg-\ning of Tyco officials, Thorn-EMI, whose fire protection operations Tyco acquired, made\nadjustments that reduced its assets and increased its liabilities by $76.5 million, resulting\nin Tyco’s operating income in future financial periods being overstated by approximately\n$29 million. At Zettler AG, a security monitoring company Tyco acquired, adjustments\nwere made to Zettler’s books that overstated its liabilities and resulted in Tyco’s operat-\ning income in subsequent reporting periods being increased by approximately $6.6 mil-\nlion. And at Carlisle Plastics, Carlisle management made entries to its books and records,\nat Tyco’s request, that reduced its assets and increased its liabilities by $36.4 million,\nresulting in an overstatement of Tyco’s post-acquisition earnings.\n\n \n\n* Obtained from U.

It expanded quickly, trading its stock on NASDAQ in the United States\nafter only a few years. Two of the main performers in the dramatic saga of Livent were\nits founders, Garth Drabinsky and Myron Gottlieb, who staged many large and lavish\nshows such as Ragtime, Showboat, and Phantom of the Opera. Not satisfied with creating\ngrand fantasies on stage, it seems they may have, according to the SEC, also performed\nsome creative artifice on the company’s financial statements.\n\nIn 1998, Livent was purchased by a U.S. consortium headed by Michael Ovitz,\nthe well-known Hollywood icon. However, it did not take long before “the new\nowners said that they had uncovered accounting irregularities” (Simon, 2002).\nToward the end of 1998, Livent declared bankruptcy in both the United States and\nCanada. In January 1999, Drabinsky and Gottlieb were indicted in the United States\non 16 counts of fraud and conspiracy, but they refused to face these charges and\nremained in Canada.\n\nIn October 2002, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police filed 19 charges of fraud\nagainst Drabinsky and Gotlieb.\n\nLivent’s irregular reporting schemes are particularly interesting because they\nwere implemented not only to present a better-looking overall income statement\nand balance sheet, which inflated the stock price, but also to make particular shows\nappear to be more successful than they really were. For instance, if Ragtime’s ticket\nsales fell below $500,000, the Schubert Theater (in Los Angeles) could evict the\ncompany. Further, if Ragtime had been evicted, according to the SEC, this would\nhave undermined its planned opening on Broadway (AAER 1095, 1999). Therefore,\nit became important for Livent to report high ticket sales even if the seats were\nnot filled.\n\nThe Livent case is presented here because it contains some clear examples that\nalert the reader to the frequently committed, old-fashioned fraud of omitting expenses\nand the corresponding liabilities by simply failing to record invoices in the ledger during\nthe correct period. Such improper expense recognition understates both expenses and\nliabilities and overstates earnings. (Improper expense recognition refers to the omis-\nsion of expenses or movement of expenses from the financial statements in the period\nin which they should be recorded to an earlier or later period.) Livent is also presented\nas a good example of the scheme of improperly deferring expenses via transferring\ncosts from their correct accounts to other accounts to delay amortization. (Improper\ndeferral of expenses refers to any technique that avoids the recording of an expense in\nthe current period by shifting the recognition of the expense to a later period’s financial\nstatements.)\n\nThe Sarbanes-Oxley (SOX) Report’s study of SEC enforcement actions found that\nthe most common method of misstating financial reports was improper expense rec-\nognition via a “lack of accrual” of expenses and their corresponding liabilities. This is\na subset of the SEC category described as “Failure to Record Expenses or Losses via\n''"

Livent’s financial statements also contained some examples of improper\ncapitalization.\n\nAs is usually the case, the SEC findings also alleged other overlapping irregu-\nlarities in Livent’s financial reporting. The company understated some expenses by\ncapitalizing them as assets (and moved expenses to different periods by transferring\nthe expenses to different assets or theatrical shows) to amortize them more slowly and\ndefer recognition of the expense. The SEC also found that Livent employees recorded\nrevenues before they should have by recognizing revenues that were subject to side\nagreements. In addition, they recorded fictitious ticket sales. Furthermore, the SEC\nfound that Livent’s management was involved in a “kickback scheme designed to\nmisappropriate funds for their own use” (AAER 1095, 1999).\n\nAN OVERVIEW OF LIVENT’S FICTITIOUS FINANCIAL\nREPORTING SCHEMES\n\nAllegedly, Livent’s manipulations were carefully orchestrated by senior management.\nAfter two controllers produced the general ledger each quarter, they gave the informa-\ntion to Gordon Eckstein, the former vice president of finance and administration, who\nsummarized the information. The SEC alleged that Eckstein then met with Livent’s top\nexecutives. At these meetings, they “agreed on the approximate nature and quantity\nof adjustments to be made .. . in order to achieve a predetermined false financial pic-\nture”! (AAER 1095, 1999). After the adjustments were completed, Eckstein met with\ntop management again, with an adjusted general ledger, and further specific adjust-\nments were directed.\n\nThe SEC states that senior management provided “approximate dollar adjust-\nments that they [i.e. staff] were required to make to various accounts in the balance\nsheet and income statement, including expense categories, specific shows and fixed-\nasset accounts.” In addition, the SEC found that Drabinsky, Livent’s former CEO, and\nGottlieb, the company’s former president, “. . . from at least 1994 through the first quar-\nter of 1998... engaged in a deliberate manipulation of Livent’s books and records.” As\na result of these manipulations, which were orchestrated together with other officers\nand employees of the company, expenses were understated for the purpose of inflating\nprofits. There were many adjustments that they could not enter, however, because such\nadjustments “would have left a trail of ‘red flags’ for the auditors.” Therefore, senior\n\n \n\n\"Livent submitted an offer of settlement and consented to the entry of the order without admitting or denying\nthe findings as set out in AAER 1095 (1999).\n\n169\n''"

The SEC findings described the company’s actions\nas follows:\n\n.. .at the end of each quarter, Livent simply removed certain expenses and the\nrelated liabilities from the general ledger, literally erasing them from the compa-\nny’s books. In the succeeding quarter, the expenses and related liabilities would be\nre-entered in the books as original entries. This blatant accounting manipulation\nviolated the basic tenets of GAAP. The amount of expenses moved from current\nperiods to future periods was tracked at Livent as the “Expense Roll.” This manip-\nulation permitted significant redirection in show expenses while also increasing\nprofits. For example, the total expenses rolled from the first to the second quarter\nof 1997 was [sic] approximately $10 million. (AAER 1095, 1999)\n\nSpecific invoices were periodically identified as part of the effort to adjust reported\nprofits. Then, on an invoice-by-invoice basis, they were deleted from the account-\ning system. This understatement of expenses and liabilities of $10 million for the first\nquarter of 1997 was a significant part of the financial misstatements. The Commission\nfound that for 1997, Livent reported a pretax loss of $62.1 million, when its actual loss\nwas a minimum of $83.6 million.\n\nScheme #2: Improper Deferral of Expenses\n\nLivent also represents an example of the failure to record expenses or losses by means\nof improper deferral. In this instance, as is often the case, Livent achieved the deferral of\nexpenses by moving the cost from one asset account to another, where the amortization\ncould be delayed. This is a prevalent method of moving expenses from current periods\nto future periods. According to the SEC:\n\nLivent transferred costs from one show currently running to another show that\nhad not yet opened or that had a longer amortization period. This accounting\nmanipulation increased profits in a particular quarter by reducing the charge for\n''"

For example, in 1996 and 1997, approximately $12 million\nrelating to seven different shows and twenty-seven different locations was trans-\nferred to the accounts of approximately thirty-one different future locations and ten\nother shows then in process. (AAER 1095, 1999)\n\nLivent internally tracked the amortization moved in this manner from current\nperiods to future periods under the clandestine label of the “Amortization Roll.”\n\nVariations on this scheme of deferring current expenses to later periods include\nextending the time period over which assets are amortized and making changes in\naccounting policies regarding the capitalization of costs. Two possible manipulations to\nlook out for are changes regarding policies for the capitalization of software costs and\nthe capitalization of pre-opening costs.\n\nScheme #3: Improper Capitalization of Expenses\n\nAs an example of improper capitalization of expenses, Livent also transferred prepro-\nduction costs for shows to fixed asset accounts, such as those for construction of the-\naters. Livent’s preproduction costs should have been expensed through amortization\nover the life of the shows (up to a period of not more than five years) once the shows\nbegan. However, fixed assets were amortized over periods up to 40 years. In 1997,\nLivent transferred preproduction costs and operating expenses “totaling $15 million\nfrom six different shows in thirty locations to three different fixed asset accounts”\n(AAER 1095, 1999).\n\nAdditional Miscellaneous Schemes\n\nIn addition to finding that Livent understated expenses in the previously noted matters,\nthe SEC also found that Livent misstated revenues. During 1996 and 1997, Livent recog-\nnized $34 million of revenue on transactions that utilized side agreements that required\nLivent to repay the revenues that it received. This is an example of either improperly\ntimed revenue (if a later transaction with full economic substance materializes) or ficti-\ntious revenue (if there is no intention of finalizing a proper transaction later on).\n\nFurther, in an effort to make the Los Angeles production of Ragtime look more\nsuccessful, senior management of Livent arranged for outside associates to purchase\napproximately $381,000 of tickets on personal credit cards and to make future ticket\npurchases using personal checks. The amounts were reimbursed to these individu-\nals’ companies and recorded as Livent’s payments for fixed assets. This is a clear\nexample of both reporting fictitious revenue and overstating assets. Also, even before\nLivent was a listed company in the United States, the SEC alleged that Drabinsky\nand Gottlieb engineered a kickback scheme in which the two got outside individu-\nals to inflate invoice amounts to Livent, which Livent paid and for which approxi-\nmately $7 million was kicked back to Drabinsky and Gottlieb between 1990 and 1994\n(AAER 1095, 1999).\n\nAll in all, as a result of an independent investigation by KPMG Peat Marwick,\nLivent restated its financial statements for the years 1996 through the first quarter of\n1998. These restatements resulted “in a cumulative adverse effect on net income in excess\nof $98 million (Cdn.)” (AAER 1095, 1999). Trading of Livent stock was suspended, and\nwhen trading briefly recommenced after the restatement, Livent’s stock “plummeted\n\n171\n''"

Also, if a category of expense has a significant fixed-cost element and the\nexpense remains the same percentage of sales as sales decrease, it is an indication that\nsome of the fixed expenses may not be recorded. Fixed costs increase as a percentage of\nsales when sales volume declines.\n\nSIGNAL #2: DECREASE IN CURRENT LIABILITIES AS A PERCENTAGE OF CURRENT ASSETS\nOR OF SALES When the company first omits recording expenses and current lia-\nbilities, this omission decreases the company’s current liabilities as a percentage of\ncurrent assets and as a percentage of sales. Such a change could, of course, be the\nresult of an improvement in efficiency or of legitimately paying off current liabilities\nearlier—for example, by obtaining a long-term loan. However, if the decrease in cur-\nrent liabilities does not seem to be explained by efficiency or by a form of longer-term\nfinancing on the balance sheet and Signal #1 is also in force—that is, expenses show\na decrease as a percentage of sales—the warning signs get stronger. If the Notes to\nthe Financial Statements show the makeup of current liabilities, check to see whether\naccruals for individual current liabilities decrease as a percentage of sales compared\nto previous periods.\n\nThe existence of both signals could be a strong alert that there has been a failure to\nrecord expenses and the corresponding liabilities. With these frauds, attempts should\nbe made to locate these signals early on. Although the initial omissions of the expenses\n''"

If the ratio is lower than the industry average or if it is\ndecreasing, it is an indication that some expenses may be recorded as assets or that the\ninvestment in assets is not efficient in that it is not producing sufficient revenue.\n\nSIGNAL #2: CHANGE IN POLICY FOR CAPITALIZATION OF COSTS Be on the alert for\nnotes to the financial statements that indicate that there has been a change in policy\nregarding the capitalization of costs. Although this signal was not present in the case\nof Livent, because the SEC found that Livent contradicted its own accounting policy\ndescription when it miscapitalized costs, a note regarding a change in capitalization\npolicy is often a blatant signal of an aggressive accounting policy to intentionally\ndecrease recorded expenses.\n\nSIGNAL #3: WRITE-OFF OF COSTS PREVIOUSLY CAPITALIZED One must be on the alert\nfor aggressive capitalization of costs when a company writes off costs that were\nformerly capitalized. According to Mulford and Comiskey (2002), a good example\nof possible aggressive accounting with regard to capitalization policies is American\nSoftware, which capitalized the majority of its software costs in 1997, wrote down a\nlarge amount of capitalized software costs in 1999, and then increased the percentage\namount capitalized again in 2000. A write-off of previously capitalized costs shows\nthat the company has been wrong in the past about the ability of a current cost to hold\nvalue in future periods.\n\nSIGNAL #4: UNUSUAL CAPITALIZATION POLICY Read the notes to the financial\nstatements to compare the company’s capitalization policy to the capitalization policy\nof other companies in the same industry. If a company capitalizes costs that other com-\npanies in the industry do not, it could be an alert that the company may be aggressive\nin capitalizing expenses.\n\nARE THEY LIVING HAPPILY EVER AFTER?\n\n¢ Garth Drabinsky and Myron Gottlieb were convicted of fraud and forgery by\nthe Ontario Superior Court of Justice in Canada in 2009.

In February 1995, Alex Grass\nhanded what he reportedly called “the keys to the kingdom” to his eldest son, Martin\nGrass, who became CEO of Rite Aid. Several years earlier Martin’s younger brother,\nRoger, had resigned from his position as a senior vice president at Rite Aid because “he\nrecognized that the top job would go to a brother he considered incompetent.” (Quotes\nfrom Berner & Maremont, 1999)\n\nLess than five years after taking charge of Rite Aid, Martin Grass was fired. That\nsame week an article in the Wall Street Journal remarked that the impact of Martin Grass’s\ntenure at Rite Aid had been “disastrous” (Quote from Berner & Maremont, 1999),\n\nAccording to the grand jury, Rite Aid was riddled with “massive accounting fraud,\nthe deliberate falsification of financial statements, and intentionally false SEC filings”\n(qtd. in “8-Year Sentence,” 2002). Documents from the SEC alleged that for over two\nyears—from the fiscal year 1998 through the first quarter of 2000—Rite Aid overstated\nits net income and that former senior management failed to disclose material informa-\ntion, including related-party transactions in 1999 (AAER 1579, 2002). The SEC maintained\nthat Rite Aid’s resulting restatements in July and October 2000—in which the company\nrestated reported cumulative pretax income by a total of $2.3 billion and restated cumu-\nlative net income by $1.6 billion—represented what the SEC called “the largest financial\nrestatement of income by a public company” at the date of that report (AAER 1579, 2002).\n\nAlthough Rite Aid did understate various expenses, most of its understatement\nof expense was its understatement of cost of goods sold, which refers to the cost of\ninventory sold during the period. Rite Aid represents a leading example of overstating\nearnings via understating cost of goods sold. It manipulated cost of goods sold through\na number of mechanisms.\n\nRITE AID’S FICTITIOUS FINANCIAL REPORTING SCHEMES\n\nRite Aid engaged in a number of schemes to reduce the cost of goods sold.\n\nScheme #1: Overstating Ending Inventory Values to Reduce Cost of\nGoods Sold\n\nOne of the three most significant methods that Rite Aid used to understate its cost of\ngoods sold amount was that it overstated its ending inventory by failing to write down\nits inventory amount for the full amount of the shrinkage that it suffered. (Shrinkage\nrefers to the loss of inventory between the point of production or purchase from the\nvendor and the point of sale.) This failure did not account for the largest portion of\nthe understatement of cost of goods sold, but it is presented first because understating\ncost of goods sold by overstating ending inventory values is a very common financial\nreporting fraud. The SOX Report (2002) found that this method of improper expense\nrecognition accounted for 25 SEC enforcement matters in the study period.\n\n175\n''"

              "value": "176\n\nChapter 6 ¢ Abracadabra\n\nRite Aid conducted periodic physical inventory counts at many of its stores. To\nthe extent that the physical count revealed less inventory on hand than was reflected in\nits records, Rite Aid’s official policy, of course, was to write down its inventory amount\nin its records via a “shrink” expense on the assumption that the difference was due\nto theft or loss. The SEC’s findings alleged, “In FY [fiscal year] 1999, Rite Aid failed\nto record $8.8 million in shrink”? (AAER 1579, 2002). For those stores in which Rite\nAid did not conduct a physical inventory count, Rite Aid’s policy was to estimate a\nshrink amount and accrue that amount. The SEC further alleged,“In FY 1999, Rite Aid\nimproperly reduced the accrued shrink expense for 2,000 stores resulting in an aggre-\ngate increase to income of $5 million” (AAER 1579, 2002). Thus, in total, pretax income\nfor 1999 was allegedly overstated by $13.8 million due to overstating ending inventory\nby not recognizing the full amount of shrinkage.\n\nScheme #2: Adjusting Gross Profit Entries to Reduce Cost of Goods Sold\n\nOf all its manipulations of cost of goods sold and net income, Rite Aid’s manipulation\nof cost of goods sold via adjusting gross profit journal entries represented the larg-\nest dollar amount of its distortions, by far. It was also its most brazen scheme. Rite\nAid simply put through journal entries decreasing cost of goods sold and decreasing\naccounts payable by a corresponding amount. These entries were known internally\nas “gross profit entries.” According to the SEC, they were “determined by one person\nwithout input or review by anyone and were completely unsubstantiated.” The size\nof these adjustments was staggering. The most egregious entries were in the second\nquarter of FY 1999. The SEC found that Rite Aid allegedly “improperly reduced cost\nof goods sold and accounts payable by approximately $100 million.” It is interesting to\nnote that in each of the years that Rite Aid adjusted its cost of goods sold in this way, it\ndid so for the first three quarters of the year and then reversed the entries in the fourth\nquarter of each year. The reversal led Rite Aid to find new adjustments in the fourth\nquarter to offset the reversal. One of these adjustments was the misstatement of the\ninventory shrink, discussed previously. Another adjustment was Rite Aid’s treatment\nof vendor rebates. (Quotes from AAER 1579, 2002)\n\nScheme #3: Improper Recognition of Vendor Rebates to Reduce Cost of\nGoods Sold\n\nRite Aid was entitled to receive rebates on amounts owing to certain vendors, contingent\nupon Rite Aid’s sales of the vendors’ products. In its income statement, Rite Aid should\nhave applied the rebate only to purchases relating to goods that it had already sold. The\nSEC stated that regarding $77 million of such refunds that Rite Aid recognized for FY\n1999, the sales had not yet occurred. In addition, the purchasing agreements had not yet\nbeen legally finalized. Nevertheless, on the last day of FY 1999, Rite Aid reduced cost\nof goods sold and accounts payable by $42 million and, in the same way, reopened its\nbooks to recognize the other $33 million of those rebates after the close of FY 1999. The\nSEC noted quite pertinently that at that particular stage, it “was readily apparent that\n\n \n\nRite Aid consented to the issuance of the order without admitting or denying the findings as set out in AAER\n1579 (2002).\n''"

These entries\nviolated GAAP because the credits were unearned as of FY 1999” (AAER 1579, 2002).\n\nOther Rite Aid Manipulations\n\nAccording to the SEC, Rite Aid also employed a number of other methods to overstate\nits reported income. One ploy was that it failed to write off capitalized costs, such as\nlegal services and title searches in respect of possible new stores, when it decided not\nto construct such stores. Another alleged Rite Aid ruse, according to the Commission,\ninvolved the company’s “will-call” accounts payable. A number of prescription medica-\ntions had been ordered but not collected by Rite Aid customers. Rite Aid, however, had\nbeen paid for these medications by the customers’ insurance carriers. Instead of return-\ning the payments to the insurance companies, Rite Aid reversed the accounts payable\ninto profit “without sufficient justification or basis in violation of GAAP. Ultimately,\nthe accrual was re-established and the $6.6 million attributable to the will-call payable\nwas repaid to the insurance carriers” (AAER 1579, 2002).\n\nThe SEC also found that Rite Aid allegedly failed to properly accrue an expense\neach quarter with respect to the stock appreciation rights (SARS) that the company\ngranted to certain field managers. (Stock appreciation rights refer to compensation\nin which employees receive the opportunity to participate in any increase in value of\nthe company’s stock without having to incur the cost of actually purchasing shares.)\nEach quarter, Rite Aid should have accrued an expense based on the market price of\nits stock at the end of the quarter. The Commission found that in FY 1998 and 1999, Rite\nAid allegedly “should have recorded an accrued expense of approximately $22 and\n$33 million respectively” (AAER 1579, 2002).\n\nThe SEC’s summary of Rite Aid’s overstatement of pretax income is presented in\nTable 6.1.\n\nSIGNALS OF THE FICTITIOUS REPORTING SCHEMES OF REDUCING\nCOST OF GOODS SOLD\n\nThe three methods of understating cost of goods sold all produce similar signals.\nOverstating inventory to reduce cost of goods sold, as well as other methods of\nunderstating cost of goods sold, affect similar key ratios. For instance, inventory as a\npercentage of cost of goods sold increases when cost of goods sold is understated. This\noccurs whether the reduction of cost of goods sold is achieved by the overstatement\nof inventory or by another means. The ratio is distorted by an even greater amount if\nending inventory is overstated. Therefore, the signals for the various methods of under-\nstating cost of goods are considered together.\n\nSIGNAL #1: INCREASE IN INVENTORY AS A PERCENTAGE OF COST OF GOODSSOLD When\ninventory increases as a percentage of cost of goods sold (COGS), it is an indication that\ninventory could be overstated and that COGS could be understated. This measure is\ncalculated or presented in a number of ways. The inventory turnover ratio is a common\nmeasure of how many times an entity’s inventory has been sold or replaced during a\nperiod. The ratio is calculated as follows:\n\nInventory turnover ratio = COGS + Average inventory\n\n77\n''"

This is\ncalculated as follows:\n\nDays sales in inventory = Number of days in period + Inventory turnover ratio\nTherefore:\nDays’ sales in inventory = 365* + Inventory turnover ratio (if period is one year)\n\nIf the inventory turnover ratio decreases or if days’ sales in inventory increases, it is\nan indication of possible overstatement of inventory and understatement of COGS.

Sudden changes (either increases or decreases) should be accompanied by simple,\nlogical explanations, such as, for example, a new manufacturing technique or a change in\nthe selling price.

He was sentenced to ten years of\nimprisonment (Scolforo, 2005). Citing Brown’s advanced age, 76 at that time, his\nattorneys described the sentencing as “a de facto death sentence” (Scolforo, 2004).\nHowever, after several appeals and almost six years in prison, Brown was released\non probation (Miller, 2011).\n\nKaren Brown, Franklin Brown’s wife, brought a lawsuit against Grass for almost\n$5 million in 2011 (Miller, 2011). Karen Brown lost the case (Reisinger, 2012).\nTimothy J. Noonan, former COO and interim CEO, left Rite Aid before the\nfraud was discovered. Although not actively involved in the schemes, he was\nnevertheless accused of neglecting to report the Rite Aid fraud. He eventually\ncooperated with investigators and pleaded guilty to a “misprision” charge for\nnot reporting the fraud. He received two years of probation and a small fine\n(Federwisch, 2007).\n\nALLEGHENY (AHERF): TRICK OR TREATMENT?\n\nAllegheny (AHERF) is presented mainly as an example of understating reserves for\nbad debts.\n\nThe Allegheny Health Education & Research Foundation (aka AHERF) was described\nby the SEC Enforcement Files as a collection of nonprofit, acute-care hospitals, with\na medical university, physicians groups, and other affiliated entities. AHERF grew\nvery rapidly from its inception in Pittsburgh in 1983 to the largest nonprofit healthcare\nprovider in Pennsylvania before its sudden decline and bankruptcy in July 1998. The\nSEC subsequently found that AHERF and some of its subsidiaries, collectively known\nas Delaware Valley, allegedly “issued annual financial statements and municipal dis-\nclosure reports that materially misrepresented, among other things, AHERF’s and\nDelaware Valley’s net income” (AAER 1283, 2000).\n\nAHERF’s swift growth came at the expense of large debt, and along with the debt\ncame the pressure to appear financially stable. When a company appears to be in a finan-\ncially stressful situation, this situation can instigate a vicious cycle by making it difficult\nfor a company to obtain future financing as well as driving up its interest rates. This, in\nturn, can increase the likelihood of debt repayments being demanded, which can eventu-\nally lead to bankruptcy. Due to such an environment of high debt, the SEC concluded that\n“AHERF, through certain of its senior officers, and in violation of applicable accounting\nprinciples, misstated its financial statements and schedules” (AAER 1283, 2000).\n\nAs a holding company, AHERF did not assume liability for the preexisting debt of\nits acquired entities. The obligation to repay debt was placed on Delaware Valley, the\nnonprofit’s “obligated groups.” AHERF’s obligated groups were responsible for over\n$900 million of debt by the time of the bankruptcy in 1998. The misstated reports, in\nthis case, went beyond annual financial statements and included municipal securities\ndisclosure reports known as Nationally Recognized Municipal Securities Information\nRepositories. In a speech to the AICPA National Healthcare Industry Conference in\nAugust 2000, SEC attorney Stephen Weinstein pointed out that “the Disclosure Reports\nwere made available to the public through the Repositories and were the most easily\naccessible source of information for investors and potential investors in AHERF bonds.”\n''"

They were also aware of the considerable growth in the amount\nof these accounts receivable and attempted to solve the problem with changes in\nmanagement. However, the SEC found that as early as October 1996, “AHERF\ndecided to write off approximately $81 million in Delaware Valley patient accounts\nreceivable.”° To do this, the company needed to increase the bad debt reserve\non the June 30, 1996 financial statements, in which the reserve was short of this\namount by approximately $40 million. AHERF should have increased that reserve\nby $40 million and recognized the expense of $40 million in the income statement.\nHowever, the conglomerate did not adjust its 1996 financial statements. Instead, it\ndecided to write off the uncollectible accounts receivable in quarterly installments.\nThe SEC found that in the audited financial statements as well as in the Disclosure\nReport distributed by AHERF to the public, properly adjusting the bad debt reserve of\nDelaware Valley would have “reduced its reported net income of $27 million before\nextraordinary item and change in accounting principle by approximately $40 million\nand similarly reduced its reported net accounts receivable figure of $253 million by\napproximately $40 million.” Furthermore, the MD&A section of the AHERF Disclosure\nReport “implied that the $72.2 million increase in Delaware Valley accounts receiv-\nable during fiscal year 1996 was a temporary phenomenon that would resolve itself.”\n(Quotes from AAER 1283, 2000)\n\nAHERF’s Other Fabrications\n\nThe SEC also found that AHERF inappropriately transferred $99.6 million of reserves\nfrom the various hospitals to Delaware Valley in 1997 to avoid recognizing the expense\nin its income statement when it had to write off accounts receivable and did not have a\nsufficient bad debt reserve. Also in 1997, AHERF overstated its reported consolidated\nnet income by incorrectly recognizing over $54 million of irrevocable trusts’ income as\nits own income.\n\nSIGNALS OF THE FICTITIOUS REPORTING SCHEME OF UNDERSTATING\nBAD DEBTS\n\nHere is an examination of some of the signals indicating that a company may have\nunderstated its reserve for bad debts.\n\nSIGNAL #1: UNUSUALLY LARGE NET ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE When a company fails to\nrecognize its bad debts by failing to increase the reserve for bad debts, the net accounts\nreceivable is larger than it should be. This is likely to show up in ratios that measure\naccounts receivable as a percentage of sales (for example, an increase in DSO).\n\n \n\n° AHERF consented to the entry of the findings and the issuance of the order without admitting or denying\nthe findings as set out in AAER 1283, 2000.\n\n181\n''"

If the reserve or allowance for doubtful debts decreases while the gross amount\nfor receivables increases, consider that a red alert.\n\nSIGNAL #3: INCREASE IN ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AS A PERCENTAGE OF TOTAL CURRENT\nASSETS When net accounts receivable increase as a percentage of total current assets,\nit could be a signal that the company is not writing off bad debts or is not appropriately\nestimating its reserve for doubtful debts.\n\nSIGNAL #4: CASH FLOW FROM OPERATIONS LAGGING BEHIND OPERATING INCOME When\na company does not appropriately recognize an expense, CFFO will lag behind operat-\ning income. Bad debts that are not written off represent operating profit that is recog-\nnized in the income statement but that should be expensed because the profit will not\nbe liquidated. In other words, the accounts receivable asset will not be paid and will not\nturn into a cash asset. Therefore, the bad debts not written off will show up in the form\nof CFFO being less than operating profit if it is not disguised by some further misstate-\nment in the statement of cash flows.\n\nARE THEY LIVING HAPPILY EVER AFTER?\n\n° Sherif Abdelhak, former CEO of AHERF, pleaded no contest to charges of raid-\ning the company’s charitable endowments in order to bolster AHERF’s deterio-\nrating healthcare system. In August 2002, he received up to 23 months in prison\n(Becker, 2002). After serving three months of his sentence, Abdelhak was released\non parole (Becker, 2003). According to a November 2007 newspaper article, “For\nMr. Abdelhak, the period after the demise of AHERF has included jail time, a divorce,\nan aborted oil-buying venture, a personal bankruptcy filing and a recent U.S. Tax\nCourt order that he pay more than $500,000 in back taxes” (Fitzpatrick, 2007).\n\n¢ David McConnell, former CFO of AHERF, agreed to participate in an “accel-\nerated rehabilitative disposition program” and was fined $25,000 by the SEC\n(Bowling, 2013).\n\nLOCKHEED: SKY HIGH®\n\nLockheed is presented mainly as an example of failing to record impairments of assets.\n\nAs jet travel boomed in the 1960s, there was such a demand by the airlines for larger\nwide-bodied jets to carry more passengers that two large airline manufacturing compa-\nnies, McDonnell Douglas and Lockheed, pursued plans to design similar aircraft with\nsimilar ranges and load capacities. While McDonnell Douglas launched its DC-10 project,\nLockheed began its design and production of the TriStar. Although pilots and aviation\nenthusiasts still rank the TriStar’s performance and safety record highly, the ambitious\nand costly TriStar program was dogged with financial problems almost from its outset.\n\n \n\n°Background information in this section is mainly from “Lockheed L-1011 TriStar,” “Lockheed L-1011 TriStar\nHistory” (2003), and Mondout and Schilit (2002).\n''"

              "value": "Chapter 6 * Abracadabra\n\nAs gas prices soared in the 1970s and demand for air travel fell, it became clear\nthat there was only enough traffic for one of the new plane designs. By this time, how-\never, too many sunk costs had already been invested in the production of the aircraft.\n(A sunk cost refers to a cost that has already been incurred and the expenditure cannot\nbe reversed by any future decision or action.) As Patrick Mondout explained, “Even if\nthe L-1011 [TriStar] was ‘technically superior’ to the DC-10, it cost more to purchase and\nmore per passenger mile than its competitor.” Furthermore, Lockheed’s initial estimates\nwere that the break-even point on the TriStar would be sales of 300 aircraft. However,\nwith cost overruns, the break-even point actually required sales of 500 aircraft.\n\nLockheed’s problems with the TriStar originally began with its choice of the\nBritish Rolls-Royce RB-211 engine for its new plane. Interestingly, David Huddie, head\nof Rolls-Royce’s Aero Engine Department at that time, later received a knighthood from\nthe Queen of England for securing the contract to supply the engine for the TriStar.\nHowever, the Rolls-Royce engine was still in the design stage and the costs for this\nengine skyrocketed long before it was ready to propel an aircraft. Lockheed, therefore,\nhad to carry a share of the climbing Rolls-Royce costs while its own development costs\nwere growing well over budget.\n\nIn December 1970, the TriStar took off from Palmdale, California, on its first flight.\nThat same year Rolls-Royce was driven into quasi-bankruptcy which, according to some\nsources, was a result of the TriStar project. The entire venture was now in jeopardy, and\nfor the program to continue, it took the combined efforts of the British government\ntaking over Rolls-Royce and the U.S. government providing a federal guarantee for\nLockheed to receive a $250 million line of credit.\n\nUltimately, Lockheed’s accounting tale is the story of misstating earnings by fail-\ning to write off an impaired asset, which was the development cost of its TriStar L-1011\nwide-body jet. (An impaired asset refers to an asset whose carrying value is less than\nthe fair or recoverable value.) This evidently inadvertent accounting failure certainly\ndrew the attention of the shareholders when the company suddenly wrote off over\n$400 million of the TriStar’s development costs in 1981, after the program had been\nlosing a fortune for over a decade.\n\nLOCKHEED’S FICTITIOUS FINANCIAL REPORTING SCHEME OF FAILING\nTO ACCOUNT FOR ASSET IMPAIRMENTS\n\nLockheed had an accounting policy in which it capitalized the TriStar’s development\ncosts with the intention of writing them off as the planes were sold. The company esti-\nmated the total development costs as well as the total number of TriStar aircraft that\nit would sell and then calculated an average development cost per airplane. As each\naircraft was sold, this average development cost was expensed and a corresponding\namount was written off the development-cost asset.\n\nBy late 1975, Lockheed had capitalized $500 million in TriStar development costs\n(Schilit, 2002). The TriStar program was continuing to suffer losses. It became clear that\nfuture sales were not going to be made at a profit and that this “asset” was impaired\nand needed to be written off. However, instead of writing off the entire $500 million,\nLockheed wrote off that amount in annual installments of $50 million. The TriStar\nprogram lost over $900 million up to 1981, when Lockheed finally wrote off the remain-\ning amount of this impaired asset in one lump sum of $400 million (Mondout, “Lockheed\nL-1011”). By the end of 1983, when Lockheed ceased production of the TriStar, only\n\n183\n''"

The\nindication that a product or program associated with the intangible asset is incurring\nproblems or setbacks can often be found in press articles, notes to the financial state-\nments, the segmented income statement, or the MD&A section of the annual report.\nIn Lockheed’s case, press articles pointing toward the losses of the TriStar program\nwere abundant, and the capitalization of significant development costs for the program\nwere clearly indicated on the balance sheet and in notes to the financial statements.\nThis signal ought to have alerted users of the financial statements to the possibility that,\neventually, Lockheed would have to recognize a huge expense to write off this asset.\n\nSIGNAL #2: A COMPANY WITH LARGE INTANGIBLE ASSETS INCURRING A LOSS When\nthere are significant intangible assets and a company is incurring a loss overall, it is an\nindication that the intangible assets are impaired. Although this signal is not always\nclear as to which assets are impaired, it is logical to assume that the purpose of assets\noverall is to produce future profits, and if they are not producing profits currently, it is\nan indication that they might not produce them in the future. It may even be argued that\nif a company is not likely to produce a supernormal return on its tangible assets, the net\nvalue of all its intangible assets is zero. Certainly, a company cannot continue to incur\nlosses indefinitely, and if it goes into bankruptcy or scraps a segment, certain intangible\nassets—such as development costs, start-up costs, and goodwill—will not be saleable.\n\nSIGNAL #3: DECREASE IN A COMPANY’S ASSET-TURNOVER RATIO When a company’s\nasset-turnover ratio declines, either for a category of assets or for total assets, it is an\nindication that the assets may be impaired. When the sales-to-total-assets ratio declines or\nthe ratio of sales to a specific asset declines, the user of financial statements should be alert\nto the possibility that either some assets are failing to achieve their objectives (and the\nassets may be impaired) or the assets should not have been capitalized in the first place.\n\nSIGNAL #4: ACCOUNTING POLICY INDICATING SLOW ASSET WRITE-OFF Accounting pol-\nicy notes to the financial statements indicating that the company has a policy that is\nslower than other companies in the industry to write off assets—such as development\ncosts or start-up costs—should alert the reader to the possibility that the company is\naggressive in its efforts to overstate the value of assets. Such aggressive policies often\ninclude the failure to record the impairment of assets.\n''"

Perhaps the only difference is that I went to work for\na company where it was easy to be ethical and Tim went to work for Rite Aid.\nI'd like to think that I would have acted differently or escaped some of the traps\nTim will talk about—I would like to think that, but I’m far from sure that would\nbe true.*\n\nNoonan outlined his purpose by saying, “I’m here today to spend a little bit of\ntime with you to talk about the crisis at Rite Aid. It could have been your company,\nyour associations. It could be anyone’s. It was a real crisis. And I hope it’s the kind\nof crisis that none of you ever get yourself caught up in,” he said. “I made some bad\ndecisions, but ultimately, you’ve got to make some right decisions. I’m no different\nthan you. I want you to understand that this could happen to you, it could happen\nto anybody.”\n\nHistory of the Rite Aid Crisis\n\nAlex Grass founded Rite Aid, a mom-and-pop health and beauty aids store, in\nScranton, Pa., in 1962. The company went public in 1968, and by 1995, Grass’s son\nforced him out as CEO. Amid rapid expansion, numerous acquisitions, and costly\ninnovations, Rite Aid got involved in a financial crisis resulting in a $1.6 billion\nrestatement, shareholder lawsuits, and ultimately, indictments and convictions\nof officers of the company. Noonan himself eventually pled guilty to misprision,\ndefined as the failure by someone who is not an accessory to prevent or notify the\nauthorities of a felony.\n\nNoonan began at his career at a pharmacy that was eventually acquired by Rite\nAid, moving from stock boy, to pharmacist, to COO and eventually to interim CEO\nof Rite Aid. The company had state-of-the-art warehouses and an innovative robotic\npharmaceutical system industry leading technology, unique store design, and was\nvery active in acquisitions. “The company was a great company. The employees\nwere great employees. The jobs I had were the greatest jobs you’d ever want to\nhave,” he said.\n\nNot that there weren’t ethical questions even early in his career. He confronted\nmanagement about a possibly illegal 50-cent surcharge on Medicare prescriptions\nand refused to make questionable payments.\n\nShould he have left the company then, he asked. “These things were few and far\nbetween, but they did happen. And they did raise eyebrows.” Taken as a whole, they\ndid not reflect well on the company’s ethical culture but were minor transgressions,\nNoonan concluded.\n\nThe Whole Truth\n\nBut there was a definite crisis when Noonan left the company; there was a cash flow\ncrisis, a major drop in the stock price, and rumors of manipulation of the company’s\nfinancials. He got called in to speak to a law firm brought in to investigate the situation.\n\n“There is no question that when I went to those interviews, I wasn’t fully truth-\nful. No question about it,” he admitted. “I was perfectly honest with them, upfront,\n''"

But there were some items I wasn’t truthful about that\nbecame part of this case.”\n\nFor example, although he admitted to investigators that he had gotten a sever-\nance package, he neglected to tell them about the secret, backdated package (which\nhe never exercised) that the former chief legal counsel and former vice chairman\nhanded him. It was signed by the ousted CEO after he left the company, backdated\nalmost a year, and worth millions of dollars more than his official deal. And although\nhe told them some of what he knew about pharmacy rebates, “I didn’t fully tell them\nall I knew.”\n\nAfter Noonan’s third meeting with investigators, he said, rumors ran rampant,\ninnuendoes abounded, and he decided to speak directly with government officials.\n“T wanted to clean up any of the interviews I had in the past,” he said.\n\nLying to the investigators was a big mistake, he said. “Ultimately, you have to cor-\nrect it. You have to face reality,” he said. “What I would share today is whenever you\nget yourself into these situations, you’re better off right up front facing the issues.\nKind of difficult, I’ll tell you that.”\n\nEventually, Noonan told the government what he knew. He wore a wire when\ntalking to other principals in the case. He did not get immunity, and as a result of his\nguilty plea to the felony misprision charge, he got two years’ probation, and a $2,600\nfine. He eventually paid significant dollars to resolve the shareholder lawsuit, lost\nhis severance, and was left with huge legal bills. “No question, your reputation gets\ndamaged,” he said.\n\n“You might ask why I wasn’t candid to the internal investigators when I went to\nthem,” he mused, “First and foremost, I’ll tell you it was my fault. No question about\nit. My fault. But those long-term friendships—30-plus years of relationships—they\ndo get in the way. They do have an impact on how things go.”\n\nCompounding the problem, he said, were “years of legal coaching—how to take a\ndeposition, what to say, what not to say, say it this way, don’t say it that way, change\nthe subject on this question. All that stuff comes into play. It’s not right, but it comes\ninto play.”\n\nRetrospective Red Flags\n\nDid Rite Aid have ethical lapses before the crisis? “Looking at it in retrospect, yes,”\nhe admitted. The company did not communicate or discuss ethical values. The code\nof conduct and ethics hotline were more form than substance. Positive leadership\nrole models were lacking. The company stressed the short-term result rather than the\nlong-term. Gatekeepers were ineffective.\n\nUsing Marianne Jennings’ seven signs of ethical collapse as a guide, he noted that\nhe could probably give a concrete example of each one. Pressure to achieve numbers.\nPervasive fear and silence. Larger-than-life CEO. Weak board. Conflicts of interest.\nInnovation like no other. Goodness “there” atones for wrong-doing “here.”\n\n“They were all there. Were they something that you could have looked at and\nseen? Probably not,” he said. “I don’t want to paint the picture that you could see\nthis on the wall. There were a lot of other things going on.”\n\nBut were there warning signs that he probably should have paid attention to?\n“Sure,” he admitted. He knew the company was operating in gray areas. “I knew\n\n187\n''"

This is a financial fraud, reporting, and internal controls case against Navistar,\na Fortune 200 manufacturer of commercial trucks and engines, and certain current and\nformer employees. At times from 2001 through 2005, Navistar overstated its pre-tax\nincome by a total of approximately $137 million as the result of various instances of mis-\nconduct. Fraud at a Wisconsin foundry and in connection with certain vendor rebates\nand vendor tooling transactions accounted for approximately $58 million of that total.\nThe remaining approximately $79 million resulted from improper accounting for cer-\ntain warranty reserves and deferred expenses. These findings do not reflect a coordi-\nnated scheme by senior management to manipulate the Company’s reported results\nor conduct committed with the intent of personal gain. Instead, these findings reflect\nmisconduct that resulted in large part from a deficient system of internal controls, evi-\ndenced in part by insufficient numbers of employees with accounting training, a lack of\nwritten accounting policies and procedures, and flaws in the Company’s organizational\nstructure. The internal control deficiencies, in turn, resulted from senior management’s\nfailure to dedicate sufficient resources and attention to the adequacy of Navistar’s\naccounting and reporting functions. The deficient internal controls failed to provide\nadequate checks on certain employees’ efforts to meet the Company’s financial targets.\n\nPARAGRAPHS 17-22 FROM AAER 3165:\nVendor Rebates\n\n17. During the 2001 to 2004 time period, Navistar ramped up its engine production\nbeyond initial expectations and correspondingly increased its purchases of engine parts from\nsuppliers. Navistar sought to share in those suppliers’ unanticipated profits by asking them\nto pay a portion back to the Company in the form of rebates. Under GAAP, a company could\nrecognize rebates only when they were actually earned, i.e., when the entity had substantially\naccomplished what was necessary to be entitled to such rebates. Accordingly, Navistar could\nrecord the full rebate as income in the then-current period only if no contingencies existed on\nits right to receive the rebate. Conversely, the Company was prohibited from booking rebates\nas income in the then-current period if they were based on future business.\n\n18. During this period, Navistar booked 35 rebates and related receivables from its\nsuppliers. Of those rebates and receivables, as many as 30 were improperly booked. While\nthese rebates and receivables took different forms—including volume-based rebates and so-\ncalled “signing bonuses” for Navistar’s award of new business—all were improperly booked\nas income in their entirety upfront, even though, in whole or in part, they were earned in\nfuture periods. The Company’s eventual restatement of these rebates and receivables totaled\n$9.7 million of pre-tax income in 2004 and $8.5 million in 2003, which represented 27.7 percent\nand 2.7 percent, respectively, of the restated loss before income taxes for those years.\n\n19. The vast majority of these receivables were volume-based rebates that\nNavistar obtained from its suppliers at the end (or even after the end) of the fiscal\n\n \n\n* The findings herein are made pursuant to Respondents’ Offers of Settlement and are not binding on any other\nperson or entity in this or any other proceeding.\n''"

As contingent consideration for paying these rebates, however, many suppliers\nrequired the Company either to agree to new business or to repay the amount of the\nrebate in the form of waived price concessions on already-agreed upon future business.\nThe Engine Division booked these rebates, often using the same form letter (which\nin certain instances was back-dated) that falsely stated that the rebate was based on\npast purchases and had no contingencies. In some instances, certain Engine Division\nemployees also generated side-letter arrangements with vendors that detailed that\nthe rebates were contingent on future purchases and/or the vendor could recoup the\nrebate through inflated future prices by which the Company would forego agreed-upon\nprice reductions. Additionally, these side-letters stated that Navistar would refund the\nrebate accordingly if the Company failed to make sufficient future purchases. These\nside-letters made clear that these rebates had not actually been earned at the time the\namounts were recognized.\n\n20. In one instance, “Vendor Rebate 1,” a supplier executed a form rebate letter\ndrafted by Navistar, and dated October 19, 2004, that said the supplier was providing\nthe Company a $2.1 million rebate based on “2004 volume and piece price productiv-\nity improvements.” However, the very next day, October 20, 2004, the parties executed\na side-letter arrangement that specifically stated that half of the rebate was based on\npulling forward productivity improvements expected to be achieved in 2005. Navistar\nalso agreed to refund any shortfall to the supplier should these 6 improvements not\nbe achieved. Thus, the side-letter made clear that the supplier’s rebate was contingent\non future business with the Company. Nevertheless, Navistar approved the rebate and\nbooked the entire dollar amount in fiscal year 2004.\n\n21. Another form of these improperly-booked rebates were so-called “signing\nbonuses” that Navistar demanded and received from certain suppliers in exchange for\nawarding new business. Despite the fact that the suppliers’ payments were contingent\non receiving that new business from Navistar, the Company booked the rebates in their\nentirety during the then-current period in which they were received, instead of when\nearned over the period of the future business.\n\n22. In one such instance, “Vendor Rebate 2,”MclIntosh contacted Stanaway four days\nafter the 2003 fiscal year-end to discuss the need to fill an earnings shortfall. Stanaway, in\nturn, discussed the shortfall with Akers, who in exchange for promising to provide future\nbusiness to a particular supplier in 2004, convinced the supplier to agree to pay a $6.2 million\nsigning bonus to the Company and to provide Navistar with a letter that would allow the\nCompany to book the full amount in 2003. The vendor had never before done business with\nNavistar. Akers had engaged in previous discussions with the vendor about possible future\nbusiness and the payment of a signing bonus, but the terms of the signing bonus were not\nfinalized until after the 2003 fiscal year-end. Stanaway, who had no direct role in acquiring\nthe rebate, then approved an entry recording the $6.2 million as income in 2003.\n\nPARAGRAPHS 33-43 FROM AAER 3165\n\nWarranty Reserve\n\n33. Beginning in fiscal year 1999, the Engine Division assumed responsibility\nfor accounting for its warranty reserve, which reflected the Company’s\nestimated future warranty costs on engines installed in the majority of Navistar\n''"

The warranty accrual estimate process began with the\nEngine Division’s Reliability & Quality (“R&Q”) group, which generated an esti-\nmated warranty cost per unit, or CPU, for each engine sold. This calculation incor-\nporated certain “above-the-line” items, including well-established or known steps\n(e.g., implemented engineering fixes) that were viewed, based on historical trends or\ndata, to have effectively reduced warranty costs. The CPU was the primary basis for the\nwarranty reserve amount; the higher the CPU, the higher the reserve.\n\n34. The warranty reserve-setting process should have been governed by account-\ning rules related to contingent liabilities. Pursuant to Statement of Financial Accounting\nStandards (“SFAS”) No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies - Appendix A; With Respect to\nObligations Related to Product Warranties and Product Defects, warranty reserves must be\nestablished when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the\nloss can be reasonably estimated.\n\n35. When R&Q’s CPU calculation was presented to Stanaway, and then ultimately\nto McIntosh, both typically stated that the initial estimated reserve number was too high\nfor the Engine Division’s business plan. Without sufficient consideration for the relevant\naccounting rules, Stanaway and McIntosh typically then directed R&Q to add certain\n“below-the-line” items to the warranty reserve calculation process because they thought\nthese items would reflect potential reductions that the Company hoped to achieve in\nfuture warranty costs. These “below-the-line” items included anticipated vendor reim-\nbursements and engineering fixes* that lacked historical trend or other data evidencing\ntheir likely effectiveness. For example, Stanaway and McIntosh directed R&Q to include\nanticipated vendor reimbursements in the warranty reserve calculation despite the lack\nof any specific language in the vendor contracts providing for such recoveries. Instead,\nthe Company relied on the existence of standard provisions in supply agreements or the\nIllinois Commercial Code to support the contemplated vendor reimbursements. During\nthe relevant period, approximately 50 percent of the vendor recoveries deducted below\nthe line from warranty reserve calculations were based on something other than specific\ncontractual language. Moreover, the Company often did not receive reimbursements\nfrom vendors for engine warranty claims. Stanaway and McIntosh also directed the\ninclusion in the warranty accrual calculation of anticipated engineering fixes that lacked\nhistorical and empirical data evidencing their likely effectiveness. Certain anticipated\nfixes were incorporated into the CPU calculation before they had even been imple-\nmented. At McIntosh and Stanaway’s insistence, R&Q included these “below-the-line”\nitems in its warranty reserve calculation, and these components consistently reduced\nthe warranty reserve.\n\n36. The inclusion of these anticipated vendor reimbursements and engineering fixes\nwas not in compliance with GAAP. Stanaway and McIntosh knew or should have known\nthat the warranty reserve-setting process was governed by accounting rules relevant to\ncontingent liabilities, yet failed to consider or apply such rules in establishing Navistar’s\n\n \n\n* Vendor reimbursements concerned payments that Navistar sought to receive from manufacturers of the failed\nengine parts that were the source of warranty claims against the Company. Engineering fixes included engine\ndesign changes (e.g., modifications to engines not yet built) and service kits (e.g., modifications implemented after\nsale to address engine problems that arose in the field).\n''"

Stanaway and McIntosh also knew or should have known that includ-\ning anticipated vendor reimbursements and engineering fixes without data evidencing\ntheir effectiveness was not in compliance with GAAP.\n\n37. The below-the-line items inappropriately included in the reserve calculation\ncaused the warranty expense to be understated by $17 million in fiscal year 2002 and by\n$18.5 million in fiscal year 2003. The $18.5 million total represented 5.9 percent of the\nrestated loss before income tax for that year.\n\nReporting Failures Regarding Certain Deferred Start-up Costs\n\n38. In 2000, the Company entered into a long-term supply contract (the “Agreement”)\nwith an automobile manufacturer (the “Automaker”) to develop and manufacture V-6\ndiesel engines commencing with model year 2002 and extending through 2012. From\nthe fourth quarter of 2001 through the fourth quarter of 2002, the Company incurred\nsubstantial start-up costs relating to the Agreement, including expenses developing the\nengine, constructing a plant in Huntsville, Alabama, and leasing engine assembly assets.\nThe Company began deferring some of these start-up costs in the fourth quarter of fiscal\n2001 and as of the fourth quarter of 2002 had accumulated $57 million of deferred pre-\nproduction costs. Production of these engines was continually delayed by the Automaker\nuntil October 2002, when it cancelled the Agreement and discontinued its V-6 engine\nprogram with Navistar.\n\n39, Relevant accounting rules provided that such start-up costs could be deferred\nonly if there existed an objectively verified and measured contractual guarantee of\nreimbursement. See FASB Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 99-5, Accounting for\nPre-Production Costs Related to Long-Term Supply Arrangements (“EITF 99-5”).\n\n40. The terms of the Agreement standing alone did not provide for reimbursement\nin a manner sufficient to satisfy the requirements for start-up cost deferral pursuant to\nEITF 99-5. The start-up costs could be appropriately deferred only if the Company had\nreceived from the Automaker a written guarantee of specific reimbursement. Without\nsuch a written guarantee, the Company was not entitled to defer these costs.\n\n41. The Company never received from the Automaker a sufficiently specific written\nguarantee of reimbursement. Beginning in September 2001 and continuing until October\n2002, when the Automaker cancelled the Agreement, Company management repeatedly\nsought such a guarantee in the form of a letter. These efforts were continually rebuffed\nby the Automaker.\n\n42. Nevertheless, the Company, through its senior accounting staff, deferred\nthese start-up costs from the fourth quarter of 2001 through the fourth quarter of 2002.\nSpecifically, the Company deferred $4.3 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2001,\n$12.8 million in the first quarter of fiscal year 2002, and $13.3 million in each of the second\nand third quarters of fiscal year 2002.*\n\n43. These deferred start-up costs were not in compliance with GAAP. While\nsenior management did receive oral assurances from Navistar senior managers that the\n\n \n\n*The Company did not file an adjusted consolidated statement of operations for fiscal year 2002 or for the 2002\nquarterly periods. See supra n. 2. Nevertheless, the dollar amounts that were deferred instead of being expensed are\nconsidered material for each of the first three quarters of fiscal year 2002. The $12.8 million and the $13.3 million\ntotals represent 12.5 percent, 65.5 percent, and 25.4 percent, respectively, of the Company’s previously reported\nloss before income tax if adjusted to reverse these deferrals for each of the first three quarters of fiscal year 2002.\n''"

In 2000, the company and Ford finalized a contract for the supply of\nV-6 diesel engines commencing with model year 2002 and extending through 2012. The\ncontract provided that the company is Ford’s exclusive source for these diesel engines\nand the company would sell these engines only to Ford for certain specified vehicles.\nTo support this program, the company developed a V-6 diesel engine, constructed\nan engine assembly plant in Huntsville, Alabama, entered into non-cancelable lease\nagreements for V-6 diesel engine assembly assets and incurred certain pre-production\ncosts. During 2002, the company deferred certain pre-production expenses related to\nthe launch of the Ford V-6 diesel engine program in accordance with Emerging Issues\nTask Force Issue No. 99-5, “Accounting for Pre-Production Costs Related to Long-\nTerm Supply Arrangements.” As of October 31, 2002, $57 million of such costs and\nexpenses had been deferred. In October 2002, Ford advised the company that their cur-\nrent business case for a V-6 diesel engine in the specified vehicles is not viable and it\nhas discontinued its program for the use of these engines. Ford is seeking to cancel the\nV-6 supply contract. As a result, the company has determined that the timing of the\ncommencement of the V-6 diesel engine program is neither reasonably predictable nor\nprobable. Accordingly, the company has recorded a non-recurring pre-tax charge of\n$167 million to write-off the deferred pre-production costs, write-down to fair value\ncertain V-6 diesel engine-related fixed assets that will be abandoned, accrue future\nlease obligations under non-cancelable operating leases for certain V-6 diesel engine\nassembly assets that will not be used by the company, accrue for amounts contractu-\nally owed to suppliers related to the V-6 diesel engine program and write-down to fair\nvalue certain other assets.\n\n \n\nFrom NAVISTAR’S 10-K 2003 NOTES, Page 58\nOther Liabilities\n\nMajor classifications of other liabilities at October 31 are as follows:\n\n \n\nMillions of dollars 2003 2002\nProduct liability and warranty $ 253 S273\nEmployee incentive programs 26 26\nPayroll, commissions and employee-related benefits 63 79\nPostretirement benefits liability 294 282\nDealer reserves 22 DA\nTaxes 235 206\nSales and marketing 56 41\nLong-term disability and workers’ compensation 52 48\nEnvironmental 8 10\nInterest 30 34\nRestructuring and other non-recurring charges 157 296\n\n(continued)\n''"

In August 2000, Enron’s stock was at an all-time high, trading\nat $90 a share. By November 2001, an Enron share was worth less than $1. What happened?\nWhy was it allowed to happen? How did the golden goose become the cooked goose?\n\nThe real story of Enron goes back to May 1985, when InterNorth—the company\nthat owned the biggest and best gas-pipeline network in the United States—merged\nwith Houston Natural Gas (HNG), whose ancestry went back to the Houston Oil\nCompany that had been formed in 1901. Twenty-four years later, in 1925, Houston Oil\nentered the gas business and formed two companies: the Houston Pipeline Company\n(to pipe natural gas) and Houston Natural Gas (to distribute the gas). By the early 1980s,\nHouston Natural Gas owned hundreds of gas wells and had annual revenue of $3 bil-\nlion. Around this time, the HNG board of directors started searching for a dynamic chief\nexecutive officer (CEO), and they believed that they had found such a man in Kenneth\nLay, who was appointed CEO in 1984. Both HNG and InterNorth were first-rate com-\npanies with impeccable credentials, and both were targets for hostile takeovers. In an\nattempt to avoid such takeovers, the two companies merged in 1985, and Lay became\nCEO of the new conglomerate, which took the name of Enron.\n\nSo perhaps the real story of Enron starts with the story of Kenneth Lay.\n\nKenneth Lay\n\nBorn in Missouri in 1942, Kenneth Lay was the son of respectable, down-to-earth\nparents who constantly struggled to make ends meet. At one stage in Lay’s early child-\nhood, after his parents’ feed store had gone bankrupt, Lay and his family “bounced\n\n203\n''"

The family was then taken in by in-laws who lived on\na small, meager farm. After that, the Lays never really regained their financial footing.\nThere are several accounts of Kenneth Lay sitting on a tractor as a child and gazing at\nthe downtown buildings he saw in the distance, daydreaming about inhabiting that\nremote world that seemed so elusive.\n\nAs so many before him, Kenneth Lay’s route out of poverty was higher edu-\ncation. After high school, he attended the University of Missouri, where he stud-\nied economics and apparently became “captivated by theories of how markets and\ncompanies work.” He went on to complete a master’s degree in economics in 1965\nand later earned a doctorate from the University of Houston. Lay married his col-\nlege sweetheart, Judith, in 1966, and within a few years, they were the proud par-\nents of a son and daughter. A couple of years after his marriage, Lay enrolled in the\nU.S. Navy. In the early 1970s, Lay’s undergraduate economics professor, Pinkney\nWalker, was appointed to the Federal Power Commission, and Walker selected Lay\nas his chief aide. During this time, Lay wrote speeches for Walker that “shook up\nWashington with their fervor for deregulation.” Washington was impressed, and Lay\nwas appointed interim deputy undersecretary for energy. (Quotes from Gruley &\nSmith, 2002)\n\nAs steep as his ascent had been from underprivileged farm boy to deputy under-\nsecretary, nobody observing the likeable, unfailingly courteous Lay would have\nguessed at the ambition that grew as he surveyed the country’s energy sector. His atten-\ntion was particularly riveted on the natural gas segment of the energy sector. Lay saw a\nhighly regulated business in which the price of gas was mandated. Pipeline companies\npaid regulated amounts to the gas producers and, in turn, received regulated prices\nfrom industrial customers and gas utilities for piping the gas to them. Lay believed\nin free markets. He was certain that deregulation would eventually come to the gas\nindustry and that it would unleash vast opportunities for making a fortune from natu-\nral gas. Adhering to this belief, he left the public sector, and with the help of another\nletter of recommendation from Walker, he landed a job in the corporate planning office\nof Florida Gas in 1974. By 1979, he was president of the company, and by anybody’s\nstandards, the once poor farm boy was rich.\n\nIn 1981, Lay was appointed president of the Houston-based Transco Energy.\nLay moved to Houston with his secretary, Linda Phillips, whom he then married after\ndivorcing his first wife. When HNG came looking for a new CEO in 1984, Lay jumped at\nthe opportunity to become CEO and chairman of this old and highly respected Houston\ngas production company. Lay was 42 years old, and he had arrived.\n\nLay soon began fretting that HNG did not have a large enough network of\npipelines. Quite coincidentally, he received an unexpected call from Sam Segnar, the\nCEO of InterNorth, asking if Lay was interested in a plan for InterNorth to acquire\nHNG. Segnar was keen to shut out the chance of a hostile takeover by a corporate\nraider and believed that all the debt InterNorth would incur by buying HNG would\nmake it immune to a future takeover. In May 1985, InterNorth acquired HNG for\n$2.3 billion.\n\nAlthough InterNorth was three times the size of HNG, the deal was done on terms\nthat were unusually favorable to HNG. The agreement included paying HNG $70 per\nshare for shares that were trading at $48 at the time of the amalgamation of the two\n''"

The InterNorth board soon regretted the merger and blamed\nSegnar for persuading them to agree to it. As a result of the inexplicably poor terms\nand other difficulties with the merger, the board of the merged companies decided to\nreplace Segnar sooner rather than later. In November 1985, it appointed Kenneth Lay as\nthe CEO of the new conglomerate.\n\nLay was now CEO of a huge company that, with over 37,000 miles of pipeline,\ncontrolled “the largest gas-distribution system in the country, running from border to\nborder, coast to coast” (McLean & Elkind, 2004, p. 10). It also had natural gas explora-\ntion plants, productions plants, hundreds of gas wells, and other energy businesses.\nLay himself had a lot to offer the new company—he was good at cajoling politicians,\nand he was on friendly terms with the future governor of Texas, Ann Richards. Lay’s\nsupport was also courted by then Governor George W. Bush. Yet in spite of Lay’s tal-\nents and the power and reach of this awesome combination of companies, the merger\nhad a strange and difficult start.\n\nAfter InterNorth’s bout of merger remorse, the next blunder—minor, yet indic-\native of a troubled future—involved the naming of the new company. The board of\nInterNorth/HNG had decided to change the name of the combined companies to\nEnteron. However, “Within days of the announcement, the soon-to-be Enteron was a\nlaughing stock.” Apparently, the dictionary definition of enteron is “digestive tube.”\nThe name was rather “unfortunate, given that Lay’s company produced natural\ngas.” So the board decided to adjust the name to Enron. (Quotes from Eichenwald,\n2005, pp. 33-34)\n\nMore ominous than the embarrassing name, Enron had another problem right\nfrom its inception—a problem that was concealed for years until it mushroomed into\na monster. The predicament was simply this: Enron began its life with too much debt.\nInterNorth’s borrowing of hundreds of millions of dollars to acquire HNG for $2.4 billion,\ncombined with other debt, meant that the newly formed Enron began its life with over\n$4 billion of debt.\n\nWhile such debt would—for good reason—discourage future hostile takeovers,\nsuch large debt also presented significant problems for the company itself. High debt\nmeans high interest expenses, which eat into profits. Also, the higher the debt relative\nto profits and to equity, the higher the risk that the debtor will default on payments.\nFor this reason, lenders charge higher interest rates for future borrowing, exacerbating\nthe problem of the high cost of capital. More troubling still, a company’s high debt can\ncause analysts to lower their “buy” ratings on the company’s stock. Perhaps most dis-\nturbing of all is that the debt must be repaid eventually, and if it cannot be repaid, the\ncompany will face bankruptcy. (Ironically, about 20 years later, at Lay’s criminal trial in\nearly 2006, his attorney would lament the fact that the banks had wanted their loans to\nbe repaid and argued that if the banks had not made this inconvenient request, Enron\nwould still be in business.)\n\nIt is unlikely that Kenneth Lay, or “Kenny boy” (as then Texas Governor George\nW. Bush had named him) worried too much about the existence of debt—it was the\nappearance of debt that he did not like. Although Lay was master of all the pipelines\nand gas wells that Enron possessed, he did not become master of its debt. While Enron’s\nmanagement certainly manipulated the reporting of its debt, they never controlled the\ndebt itself; indeed, eventually it mastered all of them.\n\n205\n''"

              "value": "206\n\nChapter 7 ¢ Enron and the Tale of the Golden Goose\n\nEnron had yet another crisis early on. At the time of the merger, a large part of\nInterNorth had moved to Houston, but its small oil-trading division, which became\nknown as Enron Oil, remained in New York and was largely allowed free rein by the\nHouston office. Louis Borget, who ran Enron Oil, liked it that way. However, a bank\nthat was doing business with Borget became suspicious and contacted Enron. Kenneth\nLay and a few other Enron employees paid a visit to Enron Oil and soon discovered\nthat “the traders were keeping two sets of books, one for legitimate purposes ... and\nanother in which to record their ill-gotten gains” (Swartz & Watkins, 2003, p. 31). It\nemerged that Borget had been incurring losses and concealing them by selling his los-\ning oil futures at a “profit” to sham companies that he had set up in order to report false\nprofits to inflate his bonus.\n\nEveryone assumed that Borget would be fired, and everyone was surprised when\nLay overlooked the fraud and kept Borget on. According to rumor, Lay explained\nhis decision by saying that Borget would be kept in line. An accountant from Arthur\nAndersen, Enron’s auditors, apparently commented later, “No one pounded the table\nand said these guys are crooks. They thought they had the golden goose, and the golden\ngoose just stole a little money out of their petty cash” (qtd. in McLean & Elkind, 2004,\np. 19). Lay’s decision would come back to haunt him.\n\nBorget was unrepentant and actually accelerated his oil futures trading. In October\n1987, Lay was in Europe and received an emergency call from Enron president John M.\n“Mick” Seidl, who set up an urgent meeting with Lay in Newfoundland. At the meet-\ning, Seidl told Lay that Enron was on the brink of collapse. Borget had committed the\ncompany to delivering a staggering $1.5 billion of oil—oil that it did not have. If word\ngot out that Enron was short this amount, other dealers would buy up the spot oil, driv-\ning up the price, and Enron would be bankrupted.\n\nLay put one of his traders, Mike Muckleroy, in charge of the salvage effort.\nMuckleroy fooled the markets by buying 8 million barrels of spot oil and then offering\neach of the major dealers 1 million barrels of oil, saying that Enron had a surplus. This\ntrick worked, and Enron was able to buy up spot oil and offload enough of Borget’s\ncontracts in the next 60 days for the company to survive. Eventually, word got out of\nEnron’s near miss, and Lay did what he would do again in 2002 on Enron’s final col-\nlapse—he denied that he had ever known of the magnitude of the trading operation\nor its risks. Borget was later convicted of fraud, jailed for a year, and fined $6 million.\nLay did not realize it then, but he was peering into a crystal ball and gazing at Enron’s\nfuture.\n\nInitially, no problems were obvious to outsiders. The golden goose appeared to\nbe sleek and plump. Over the next few years, Enron was to offer dizzying numbers of\nstock options to its executives. In fact, Lay would eventually unload over $100 million\nof his Enron stock before it became worthless.\n\nAlthough Lay had moved from the public energy sector in the 1970s in anticipa-\ntion of deregulation and the opportunity for the profits he was sure this would bring,\nhe had not yet figured out a way for Enron to capitalize on deregulation, which had\nstarted but had not unfolded as neatly as he had hoped. In fact, while the previously\nregulated gas business had been steady and predictable, the process of semi-deregu-\nlation had produced some unintended consequences. With fixed purchase prices and\nfixed selling prices, the pipeline companies had entered into long-term contracts to pur-\nchase gas for years to come. When the purchase prices were deregulated, prices fell and\n''"

In addition, because of earlier price caps, a num-\nber of gas producers had closed down, and many industrial gas plants and utilities had\nexperienced shortages of gas.\n\nAfter deregulation, selling prices shot up during times of higher demand but\nplunged at other times, making it difficult for users to predict future purchase prices\nand estimate whether or not an industrial gas plant or a gas utility would be profitable.\nTherefore, new utility companies and industrial plants increasingly used alternative\nenergy sources—such as oil and coal—and avoided gas. Soon there was an oversupply\nof gas on the market and Enron, like the other pipeline businesses, had a huge problem.\nKenneth Lay—indeed the whole gas industry—needed someone who could figure out\na way to make the deregulated gas industry profitable.\n\nJeffrey Skilling\n\nThe man that Kenneth Lay turned to was a Harvard MBA—and intermittent risk taker—\nnamed Jeffrey Skilling, who worked at the prominent consulting firm of McKinsey &\nCompany. Born in Pittsburgh in 1953, Skilling was the son of an engineer-turned-\ntraveling salesman who lost his job, forcing the family to move to Chicago, where\nSkilling, with very little effort, did exceptionally well in high school. Interestingly,\nSkilling turned down Princeton University and selected Southern Methodist University,\nin Dallas, for his undergraduate degree. After getting married and working briefly in\na bank, Skilling was accepted at Harvard Business School, where he graduated in the\ntop 5 percent of his MBA class and then joined McKinsey.\n\nAs a consultant to InterNorth, which subsequently became part of Enron, Skilling\nbegan to realize that without stable, long-term gas prices, energy users—including\nindustrial plants, utilities, and private customers—would not want to be dependent on\ngas. In addition, power producers were hesitant to explore and produce gas, and even\nwilling potential producers could not raise financing because the banks required more\nreliable estimates of future prices in order to assess whether the producers would be\nprofitable enough to repay their bank loans. The daily fluctuating spot prices of natural\ngas were just too volatile. Natural gas as a significant energy source would only make\nsense if one could get the wild instability out of the prices.\n\nThe industry was in desperate need of a business model that would provide the\nproducers and users with the mechanism to reliably predict the prices as well as the\ndemand and supply of gas. As a consultant to Enron, Skilling provided the answer—\nwhat he called the Gas Bank (Swartz & Watkins, 2003, p. 45).\n\nSKILLING'S GAS BANK The plan was for Enron itself to be the Gas Bank. Gas produc-\ners could contract to make deposits of gas with Enron for future years at previously\nagreed-upon prices. In addition, gas users could contract in advance to make withdrawals\n(purchases) of gas from Enron at specified prices for future years. Enron would make a\npercentage on the spread, much the same way a bank borrows from lenders at a certain\ninterest rate and lends to borrowers at a higher interest rate. Gas producers, industrial\ngas users, and utilities would be able to estimate future prices and cash flows more reli-\nably. Potential producers could obtain bank loans more easily for the exploration and\nproduction of new gas.\n\n207\n''"

Industrial users\nand utilities quickly signed long-term contracts to buy gas at fixed prices. However, the\nplan faltered when gas producers were not as keen to lock themselves into long-term\nselling prices. Skilling became convinced that if he ran Enron’s Gas Bank, he would be\nable to solve the problems and make it work. In 1990, Skilling left McKinsey & Company\nto join Enron as chairman and CEO of a new division known as Enron Finance.\n\nSkilling expanded his Gas Bank concept by announcing that Enron would get gas\nproducers on board by paying them up front for their contracts to deliver gas in future\nperiods; Enron was now financing gas production companies. The producers would\nlater have to deliver an assured supply of gas at fixed prices, and Skilling knew what\nprice to set for the supplies of gas in order to make a profit on the spread because Enron\nalready had contracts to sell the gas at fixed prices in the future. The Gas Bank was a\nbrilliant concept.\n\nSkilling had still bigger plans, intending to transform the gas industry even\nfurther. He decided to chop up Enron’s long-term supply contracts, as well as its\nlong-term purchase contracts, into smaller ones and offer all of them sale. In other\nwords, Skilling transformed the contracts into financial instruments to be sold on\nthe free market. He set up traders to buy and sell these financial instruments. The\npublic could now buy the right to purchase gas or to supply gas at fixed prices in\nthe future. Skilling had invented a futures market in natural gas! (A futures market\nis an exchange where parties can trade futures contracts—financial instruments in\nwhich parties agree to buy or sell quantities of a commodity at a specified price on a\nspecified future date.) Soon, companies on Wall Street followed Skilling’s lead, and\nin 1990, the New York Mercantile Exchange began trading gas futures. Enron domi-\nnated the market and “was the dominant company when it came to setting prices as\nwell” (Swartz & Watkins, 2003, p. 47).\n\nSKILLING AND MARK-TO-MARKET ACCOUNTING Once Skilling had established a\ntrading floor and staffed it with traders selling financial instruments, he started to\ndeclare that his division—Enron Finance—was the real business of Enron. Financial\nservice firms usually have a ready market price to refer to in order to establish the\nvalue of the financial instruments that they own and can readily sell. According to\ngenerally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), financial service firms should\nnormally carry the value of their financial instruments on their balance sheets at\nmarket price. If an instrument’s market value increases while a financial services\ncompany owns it, the company revalues the asset on the balance sheet (that is—\nmarks it up to market value) and correspondingly records the increased amount\nas profit on its income statement, a practice known as mark-to-market accounting.\n(Mark-to-market accounting refers to the revaluation of an asset or a liability on\nan entity’s balance sheet to its market or fair value and the corresponding record-\ning of the increased or decreased amount as income on the income statement or as\nother comprehensive income.) Although Enron was not primarily a financial ser-\nvices company, Skilling believed that he had an argument for his division to use\nmark-to-market accounting on the grounds that his division traded financial instru-\nments (gas futures).\n\nUnfortunately, there is a strong potential for abuse of mark-to-market account-\ning. It is one thing to have a market value for a futures contract to sell an asset in\n''"

In fact, it is even possible to sell that contract today on the futures market\nand receive the market price in cash. It is quite another matter if you have a con-\ntract to sell gas for the next 23 years and there are no market prices to indicate what\nyou will have to pay for the gas you intend to sell in 23 years’ time. The longer the\ncontract extends into the future, the less likely it is to estimate prices accurately.\nBecause of this risk, the futures market does not usually enter into such long-term\ncontracts.\n\nRecognizing such future profit now—that is, revaluing the asset and booking the\nrevaluation amount to current profit—involves unreliable estimates and is highly sus-\nceptible to abuse. Further, if the transaction involves actual work that must be done\nin the future to realize a future profit, the profit can only be recognized once the work\nhas been done. Mark-to-market accounting cannot be used in such situations. Bethany\nMcLean and Peter Elkind, in their book The Smartest Guys in the Room: The Amazing\nRise and Scandalous Fall of Enron (2004), pointed out, “This line of thinking suggests that\nGeneral Motors should book all the future profits of a new model automobile at the\nmoment the car is designed, long before a single vehicle rolls off the assembly line”\n(pp. 39-40).\n\nSince his arrival at Enron in 1990, Skilling had been intrigued with the idea of\nbeing able to currently record future profits using mark-to-market accounting. Then\nin late 1990, Enron signed a 23-year contract—valued at over a billion dollars—with\nthe New York Power Authority (NYPA) (Bryce, 2002, p. 65). According to accepted\naccounting practice, Enron could report only 1/23 of this revenue each year for the next\n23 years. Using mark-to-market accounting, however, Enron would be able to report\nthe entire 23 years of profit in the current quarter.\n\nAccording to Bryce (2002), the potential for reporting profits on such a long-term\ncontract convinced Skilling to adopt mark-to-market accounting. In May 1991, Skilling\npersuaded Enron’s audit committee to adopt mark-to-market accounting. With the help\nof lobbying from Arthur Andersen, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)\ngranted its permission to Enron to use mark-to-market accounting in its Gas Services\ndivision. It was unusual for a company that was not a financial institution to receive\npermission from the SEC to use mark-to-market accounting. Enron wrote back to the\nSEC and said that it planned to go ahead and use mark-to-market accounting a year\nearlier than the date approved by the SEC. To this day, it remains a mystery as to why\nthe SEC did not object to that subsequent letter from Enron. On the day that the letter\narrived from the SEC giving Skilling permission to use this new accounting policy, he\nbought champagne to celebrate with his division’s staff (Bryce, 2002, p.68).\n\nFrom this point on, Enron began to focus more on recording accounting profit\nthan on making cash—so a huge problem was born. Enron began to use mark-to-market\naccounting wherever it could. The magnitude of that loss of focus cannot be underes-\ntimated. Enron began to lose colossal amounts of cash on ill-advised projects while it\nreported “estimated” future profits as current-period profits and hid the mounting debt\nit incurred to cover the huge amounts of cash it squandered. In May 1991, when Skilling\ncracked open the champagne to celebrate his right to use mark-to-market accounting,\nhe was focused on the ability to report massive amounts of expected future earnings as\ncurrent-period profits and the boost this would give to Enron’s stock price as well as to\nhis compensation.\n\n209\n''"

As head of ECT, Skilling was an Enron\nstar on the rise. He had remade himself as the coolest guy at Enron, and Enron was the\ncoolest company in all of Texas.\n\nSkilling appointed Lou Pai, a brilliant trader with little respect for the hard-asset\npipeline business, as head of the floor and trading operations. From then on, Skilling\nallegedly wanted Enron to focus on its trading business as opposed to the hard-asset\nbusiness of actually piping gas. Over the next few years, Enron’s trading operations\ngrew in many different directions until, eventually, the trading division opened Enron\nOnline, which bought and sold over 800 different commodities. For the rest of Enron’s\nbusiness life, there would always be a tension within the company between those who\nwanted Enron to expand its “asset-lite” trading arm and those who wanted to consoli-\ndate its hard-asset pipeline business.\n\nAndrew Fastow\n\nTo fulfill his ultimate vision of Enron as a trading company, Skilling realized he had\nto find a financial expert who knew his way around the system and who could wheel\nand deal for Enron. Just a few months after moving to Enron, Skilling contacted a\ncompany of headhunters to locate such a person. They came up with Andrew Fastow.\nAt the time, Fastow was a young banker—with a degree from Tufts University and\nan MBA from Northwestern University—living in Chicago with his wealthy wife, Lea\nWeingarten, who was originally from Houston. Fastow was working at Continental\nBank, where he had become an expert in “securitization deals, or as they were known\nmore commonly, structured finance.” (Securitization refers to the pooling of loans\nand the trading of portions of these loans on securities markets in the form of collat-\neralized debt obligations.) By the time he interviewed at Enron, Fastow was already\nadept at using SPEs, which enabled a company to “monetize,” or “literally turn its\nassets into money and generate revenue.” (Quotes from Swartz & Watkins, 2003,\npp. 154-155)\n\nFastow was doing well, but he wanted to do better. He had never heard of Enron,\nhowever, and was rather skeptical when he traveled to Houston to meet Skilling. After\nall, he dwelled in the elevated world of finance, not “in pipelines—expensive, dirty\npipelines” (Eichenwald, 2005, p. 51). Skilling, however, with his unbridled enthusiasm\nand vision of Enron as a trading company, soon won over the younger man. Fastow was\nexactly the sort of Enron executive that Skilling had in mind: “Fastow’s motto—’never\nsay no to a deal’—came to mean pushing for any transaction, no matter how complex\nor how irrational” (Swartz & Watkins, 2003, p. 156). As Enron grew larger and louder,\nso did Andrew Fastow.\n\nLay, Skilling, and Fastow\n\nThe three men who would steer Enron to eventual ruin were all in place by the begin-\nning of 1990. Armed with the power to report virtually any fictitious profit it wished\nand to hide almost immeasurable amounts of debt, Enron burned through billions of\ndollars on foolhardy projects on several continents.

(Prepays refer to transactions in terms of contracts in which one\nparty enters into a contract with another party to deliver a commodity in the future at a\nspecified price.)

Enron’s traders knew better than anyone how much gas\nwas going to be needed, what supplies were available, and how much was going to be\nsupplied. If Enron discovered that a gas producer was having production problems or that\na big consumer needed more gas, the traders knew that they should invest in options\ncontracts that gave them the right to buy gas in the future at today’s price; in other\nwords, they “went long on gas.”\n\nBolstered by their success in trading gas, the traders became more inventive\nin writing derivative financial instruments and started regarding themselves as the\nEnron elite. To the eventual peril of the company, the trading arm expanded trad-\ning to a variety of businesses and commodities in areas that Enron knew absolutely\nnothing about. One particularly imaginative type of derivative that Enron began\ntrading was its “weather derivative.” The idea for this grew out of Enron’s atten-\ntion to fundamental weather information for its gas trading. Enron traders knew\nthat if a cold front was advancing, it would cause gas prices to increase; so the\ncompany employed meteorologists to help them predict the weather and, in turn,\nto predict future gas prices. In fact, all the electric and gas utilities faced risks due\nto changing prices as a result of fluctuating weather conditions. Enron saw this as\nan opportunity and began trading weather derivatives with the utility companies.\nEssentially, Enron would insure its customers against unusual weather conditions\n(Bryce, 2002, p. 243).\n\nElectricity trading worked well for Enron because several of the fundamen-\ntals behind the successful trading of gas futures also worked for trading electricity\nfutures. In 1997, Enron moved into yet another branch of energy and began trading\ncoal. Again, Enron’s knowledge of gas and electricity trading provided the basics it\nneeded for success in coal trading. At this point, however, because of the company’s\nincreasing conviction that the future of Enron lay in trading rather than energy per\nse, Enron began to drift outside the energy business that it understood and into\nareas where it had little expertise. This would cause a great deal of friction within\nthe company.\n\nHOW ENRON LOST A FORTUNE\n\nSome of the imprudent projects that caused Enron to lose billions of dollars included\nthe infamous Dabhol Power Plant in India, the Azurix water debacle in England, the\nmassive Enron Online venture that went spinning out of control, and the hugely incom-\npetent Enron Broadband Services (EBS), among others.\n\nThe Projects of Rebecca Mark\n\nRebecca Mark was a glamorous Harvard MBA graduate who had worked with John\nWing from the division that later became Enron Development.

As the new\nCEO of Enron Development, Mark set out to win power projects all over the world and\nto extend Enron’s international reach. In sharp contrast to Skilling’s trading operation\n(which was “asset-lite”), Mark’s mandate was to build hard-asset projects such as pipe-\nlines, production fields, and other energy sources to supply power plants overseas. She\ndeveloped these international projects with gusto. For example, by 1992, Enron had part\nownership in a pipeline in Argentina, and by “early 1994 Mark also had power plants in\nthe Philippines, Guatemala and Guam.” Next, Enron Development was “busy laying a\npipeline in Columbia ... [and] constructing a plant in China.” Soon Enron was working\non a pipeline that was intended to go all the way from Bolivia to Brazil. (Quotes from\nMcLean & Elkind, 2004, p. 74)\n\nHowever, there were a number of problems associated with this frenetic rate of\ngrowth. The first problem was that Mark got an up-front bonus on the signing of many\nof these huge deals. Clearly, this policy encouraged large projects that might not be\nprudent. Second, “Enron often ended up guaranteeing some or all of the debt.” Third,\nhugely optimistic assumptions were made at the beginning of the projects, assuming\nthat little or nothing would go wrong. Not surprisingly, problems and roadblocks usu-\nally did emerge. For example, a power project in the Dominican Republic caused soot\nto be blown onto a neighboring hotel, resulting in an extremely expensive lawsuit: “For\nEnron, the deal was a complete bust; through mid-2000 the company had collected a\npathetic $3.5 million from its $95 million investment.” Possibly the most infamous hard-\nasset losses for Enron—and the deals that Mark pushed hardest to accomplish—were\nthe Dabhol Power Project in India and the Azurix water project in England. (Quotes\nfrom McLean & Elkind, 2004, pp. 77-78)\n\nMARK IN INDIA: THE DABHOL POWER PROJECT In 1992, Mark tried to convince India’s\nMaharashtra State Energy Board (MSEB) to authorize a 20-year power contract with\nEnron for the province of Maharashtra. This would require Enron to build a mas-\nsive energy plant estimated to cost just under $4 billion. During its first phase, the\nplant planned to use a fuel known as “naphta,” and in the second phase, it would\nuse liquefied natural gas (LNG), a rather expensive form of energy. The project was\nnever really viable on at least two counts. First, coal was probably a better option\nthan gas for India’s electricity production. Second, the payment arrangements as\nset out in the contract were outrageously favorable to Enron but were not really\nfeasible considering that in India, the government often had to forgive many unpaid\nelectricity bills.\n\nThe project seemed doomed when the World Bank refused to finance it and the\nMSEB wanted to end negotiations. However, Mark pushed ahead and managed to get\npartial financing from banks and additional financing from the U.S. federal government\nvia the Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC). Mark also lobbied over the\nhead of the local MSEB in India, and in December 1993, the Indian government signed a\ncontract for the first phase of the 20-year project. In fact, if the terms of the contract were\nfully realized, Enron would receive over $25 billion from India (Bryce, 2002, p. 103).\nHowever, just after Enron began construction, India’s Congress Party in Maharashtra\nlost power, and the new party stopped all work on the project, claiming that Enron was\nguilty of gross overcharging.\n\n213\n''"

In spite of these amendments, the size of the financial obligation to MSEB was\nstill outrageous and would probably have bankrupted the province. The first phase\nbegan producing power in May 1999, two years behind schedule. Around this time,\ncharges of bribery and corruption at the Dabhol plant began to circulate, exacerbated\nby an anonymous letter sent to Enron’s head office. The letter also claimed that MSEB\ncould not pay its bills. The company denied the bribery charges, which were never\nproven, but the nameless writer certainly proved to be correct in one respect: MSEB\nrefused to pay for the power from Dabhol, saying it could not afford it. In spite of all\ntheir attempts, there was nothing Enron executives could do to resuscitate the project.\nThe plant remained empty and useless for five years, a stark symbol of incompetence\nand greed. In 2006, “Dabhol reopened as Ratnagiri Gas and Power ... under the tute-\nlage of two Indian government-owned firms” (Bajaj, 2010). It has, however, continued\nto be plagued with problems (Jore, 2013).\n\nMARK IN ENGLAND: THE AZURIX ACCOUNT Mark’s status began to diminish with\nthe failure of many of her international power projects. Her decline from glory was\naided by her nemesis, Jeffrey Skilling, who led the charge to have her removed\nfrom her position as CEO of Enron International (as the development division of\nEnron had been renamed). Mark’s Enron career was finally undone by her plan to\nstart a water utilities company—a sector in which she and Enron had absolutely\nno experience.\n\nToward the end of the 1990s, some countries had begun the slow process of priva-\ntizing their water utilities and wastewater facilities. Mark believed that this privatiza-\ntion would lead to deregulation, as had happened with the gas industry, and there\nwould be a great deal of money to be made in water. Two French companies, Vivendi\nand Suez Lyonnaise, were already operating water utilities for local governments\naround the world, and they were doing very well. So in 1998, Mark began the start-\nup water company called Azurix, which she financed with money from Enron via an\nEnron off-balance-sheet entity named Marlin. It was extremely difficult to get a foothold\nin this industry, and Azurix was plagued with problems from beginning to end even\nthough Mark was a hard worker and was always ready to fly around the world to drum\nup business.\n\nThe first Azurix project involved Wessex Water, a successful water utility com-\npany in England. In July 1998, Azurix purchased Wessex Water for $2.88 billion.\nHowever, by the end of the following year, seven weeks after Azurix had gone public,\nthe company was shocked when Britain’s water regulation agency announced that\nwater companies would have to drop prices. Wessex would have to cut its customer\nrates by 12 percent. To make matters worse, the Wessex facilities had to be upgraded,\nand the cost for this was astronomical. By some accounts, Azurix lost more than a\nbillion dollars in its first year of operation (Bryce, 2002, pp. 178, 187).\n\nThe next problem Mark had to face involved development costs. She had expected\nWessex Water to be the silver bullet that would facilitate Azurix’s entrance into the\nwater world, after which it could easily buy out privatized utilities or win contracts to\nmanage utilities for municipalities. However, this did not happen in spite of Mark’s\noptimism and her large development teams. In June 1999, even though Azurix was in\n''"

Buenos Aires was taking bids from private companies for a 30-year\ncontract to essentially rent and manage the Buenos Aires water utility and wastewater\nplants. While preparing to go public, Azurix had submitted an incredibly high bid\nof $439 million for the contract. The next highest bid was less than $200 million. In\nits haste to put the deal together, Azurix had ignored some significant information.\nFor example, it had not realized that the actual office buildings were not included\nin the bid and that the plant had not been well maintained. In fact, it soon became\nobvious that Azurix had made a mistake. The fatal blow to the Buenos Aires project\noccurred when an algae outbreak contaminated the drinking water in early 2000 and\nAzurix had to purchase containers of water and deliver them to its customers at a huge\nadditional expense.\n\nNot everyone believed that the failure of Azurix was entirely Mark’s fault.\nFrom the outset, her company was saddled with debt when Enron financed it via the\noff-balance-sheet entity known as Marlin. In fact, “some of the $900 million of the money\nFastow had raised [for Azurix] was paid right back to Enron.” Even though Azurix\nburned through cash with its own ill-fated projects and mismanaged development\ncosts, some claimed that Enron was not particularly supportive of Azurix and that—in\nthe battle to gain control of Enron—the “entire expensive episode had all been a grand\nconspiracy” to depose Rebecca Mark. (Quotes from McLean & Elkind, 2004, pp. 249-250).\n\nWhether or not the plot existed, Jeffrey Skilling retained his position as future\nking of Enron, and at the end of 2000, Rebecca Mark was cut loose. In spite of her des-\nperate plans to shore up the drowning company, the Enron board had lost confidence\nin her. Even Kenneth Lay agreed that Azurix had been a tremendous waste of money\nand that Mark had to resign.\n\nThe Enron board ended the Azurix hemorrhage when it paid over $300 million to\nbuy back the shares—held by the public—at just over $8 a share, when the shares were\ntrading at around $3.50 per share. In early 2001, Enron’s entire international division\nwas sold. However, because Azurix had initially been funded by the off-balance-sheet\nentity, Marlin, Enron was still on the hook for Marlin’s loans that had been used mainly\non Azurix.\n\nBefore she left Enron, Mark made a fortune by selling Enron shares. Although\nit did not seem so at the time, “Rebecca Mark was one of the lucky ones—she got out\nat the top” (McLean & Elkind, 2004, p. 263). Indeed, Mark managed to hold on to the\ngolden goose just long enough to snatch a golden egg.\n\nEnron Energy Services\n\nMeanwhile, buoyed by its rapid and spectacular success in gas trading, Enron pur-\nchased the Portland General Electric utility company in 1997 to establish itself in the\nelectricity industry. As it transpired, Enron’s experience and information base in the\ngas-trading business transferred quite well to the wholesale component of electricity\ntrading.

In addition to selling power at bargain-basement prices, Enron had to\nstart managing and maintaining electrical power plants—and it knew almost nothing\nabout this aspect of the electricity industry.\n\nWhile most of Enron’s wholesale traders expected that the cost of electric power\nwould increase. Lou Pai, one of Skilling’s chief traders, decided to take a huge gamble\nthat prices would decrease. As it transpired, the price of electricity increased dramati-\ncally toward the end of 2000 and EES lost a fortune. (Behind the scenes, of course, many\nof the wholesale traders made big profits on California’s manipulated electricity prices,\nbut this will be covered in a later section.)\n\nIt was not too long before some of the problems at EES were noticed by other\nEnron employees. In February 2001, an accountant named Wanda Curry reported to\nEnron’s chief accounting officer that she was investigating several discrepancies at EES.\nSome of these problems included the following:\n\n¢ Many of the contracts were overvalued. Enron Energy “hadn’t done much more\nthan guess at energy loads its customers would require” (McLean & Elkind, 2004,\np- 300).\n\ne EES had used “faulty price curves with their excessively optimistic assumptions”\n(McLean & Elkind, 2004, p. 300). It is important to note that with mark-to-market\naccounting, these contracts were valued using these estimates for the balance\nsheet and that the expected future profit was recognized in current-period income\nstatements.\n\n¢ The contracts were not fully hedged, so that if price changes deviated from expec-\ntations, Enron would not have other contracts that would increase in value by\ncompensating amounts.\n\ne EES faced huge losses if the California energy crisis forced Enron’s customers into\nbankruptcy, as had occurred, for example, in the case of Pacific Gas.\n\ne There were various speculative trading losses because EES had been trading on\nthe bet that electricity prices would fall when, in fact, prices rose astronomically.\n\nOverall, based on Curry’s investigation, EES needed to recognize “a loss that\nwould likely total more than $500 million” (McLean & Elkind, 2004, p. 303). But mys-\nteriously, a disclosure of these losses was nowhere to be found in Enron’s financial\nstatements.\n\nEnron Online\n\nMoving into new trading markets usually meant that Enron had no comparative advan-\ntages, and there were often huge disadvantages to having absolutely no knowledge\nof the new industry. It also involved spending and losing vast sums of money to get\nstarted. For example, Enron purchased a couple of paper mills to begin a market for\ntrading pulp and paper.\n''"

Greg Whalley, a talented trader in charge of Enron’s wholesale trad-\ning operation, supervised the acquisition of MG Plc. Enron was in such a rush to\ncomplete the purchase that most of the deal was accomplished in four days and\n“most of it done with heavy drinking in London bars” (McLean & Elkind, 2004,\np- 225). A Wall Street commodity trader is reported to have said that the metals\ncompany was worth only a fraction of what Enron had paid for it. Nobody seemed\nto care, however, because the executives at Enron were imbued with a form of\nhysteria.\n\nAround this time, an Enron team led by a British trader named Louise Kitchen\nhad developed the technology to launch Enron’s trading business on the Internet—\nand so Enron Online was born and went live in November 1999. From a purely techno-\nlogical point of view, the system was a marvel.\n\nNow the trading arm of Enron really surged, and Enron became predomi-\nnantly a trading company. Through Enron Online, the Enron traders saw the prices\nthat buyers and sellers were offering, and with that advantage, they made a great\ndeal of money on the products they really understood. However, unlike eBay,\nwhich offers a marketplace for other buyers and sellers, Enron Online actually pur-\nchased everything that it resold. This caused a huge cash flow problem for Enron\nand the company borrowed well over $3 billion in order to keep Enron Online\nafloat (Bryce, 2002, pp. 220-221).\n\nWhile Enron made profits on many of the commodities, the company was\nlosing money due to its interest expense and the trading of commodities that the\nbrokers did not understand. In addition, the trading volumes were so large that even\nin gas trading—where they had all the advantages—when the traders bet the wrong\nway, the losses were astounding. For example, when a cold arctic air front was mov-\ning toward Texas in early December 2000, many gas traders went “long” on gas,\nexpecting the price to increase. However, the cold weather never arrived and gas\nprices fell, with the result that on December 12, “The traders lost $550 million accord-\ning to one report and $630 million according to another report” (McLean & Elkind,\n2004, p. 219).\n\nThe traders were young, egotistical, belligerent, and partial to obscene\nlanguage. They were rich beyond their wildest dreams—and totally unmanageable.\nBut ultimately, they were gamblers, and they “bet—on anything” (Swartz & Watkins,\n2003, p. 79). Eventually, the gambling—like the rest of Enron—spun totally out\nof control.\n\nEnron Broadband Services\n\nIn 1997, when Enron acquired the Portland General utility company to get into the util-\nity business, an unintended consequence was that it also acquired FirstPoint, a small\ntelecommunications Internet start-up company that was a tiny division of Portland\nGeneral. As luck would have it, the stock prices of Internet companies and telecom-\nmunication companies began to rise dramatically. These companies had price-earnings\nratios far higher than Enron’s. In fact, in the late 1990s, these companies enjoyed soar-\ning stock prices even when they had negative earnings! This was a situation ripe for\nexploitation.\n\n2N7,\n''"

              "value": "218 Chapter 7 © Enron and the Tale of the Golden Goose\n\nNever one to miss an opportunity, Jeffrey Skilling turned to his newfound tele-\ncommunications division and came up with four big, bad ideas:\n\n1. Skilling decided that Enron would join the broadband investment boom by\nexpanding FirstPoint’s investment in broadband capacity. At this time, Global\nCrossing, AT&T, and all the other big telecommunication companies were overin-\nvesting in broadband capacity and chanting the erroneous mantra “Internet traffic\nis doubling every 100 days” (Malik, 2003, p. 13). So Enron joined the rush to lay\nfiber-optic lines and to acquire small telecommunications companies with broad-\nband capacity. Like everyone else, Enron would be caught with a huge overin-\nvestment in broadband capacity that was in oversupply.\n\n2. Skilling decided that Enron would trade broadband capacity, figuring that it would\nbe much like trading gas futures—but he was sorely mistaken. Enron could move\ngas in its own pipelines with its own connections all the way from the power plant\nto the utility company. However, although Enron owned a great deal of fiber-\noptic lines, it did not have the connection facilities or the lines to transmit data all\nthe way to its customers. This meant that it could not guarantee the security of the\ntransmitted information and that it would have to invest in connection facilities to\nmove the data to its customers. Skilling, therefore, planned to build “two dozen\npooling points across the globe. These pooling points would use sophisticated\nequipment [and] ... would act as hubs. Enron would buy and sell capacity on the\nInternet so that corporations and other carriers could get reliable network connec-\ntions.” However, there was a huge problem in that the technology necessary for\nSkilling’s plan to work did not yet exist: “No one had built equipment that could\nprovide instant bandwidth on demand.” Furthermore, while Enron was spend-\ning a fortune on these highly dubious plans, it had yet to find any customers.\nThe potential buyers of broadband capacity were the big telephone companies\nthat did not like Enron very much and believed that Enron’s entry into their busi-\nness was going to become a comedy of errors; they had no incentive to trade with\nEnron. (Quotes from Malik, 2003, p. 104)\n\n3. FirstPoint was renamed Enron Broadband Services (EBS), and Skilling appointed\nhis trusted friend, Ken Rice, as co-CEO. (The other CEO was Joe Hirko of the\noriginal FirstPoint.) Rice had been an exceptional salesman, landing enormous\ngas power plant deals, but he had little experience in telecommunications and\nactually wanted to retire. To his credit, he first rejected the job, but Skilling\ntalked him into accepting the position. As co-CEO with Hirko—and as Skilling’s\nfriend—Rice could do as he wished and had the final say, albeit with no knowl-\nedge of the industry. Predictably, the co-CEO arrangement did not work and Joe\nHirko left the company in July 2000. Kevin Hannon, a trader who had risen to\nthe top of Enron’s trading operations, was appointed Ken Rice’s deputy. With\nRice and Hannon at the helm of EBS, Skilling believed that Enron would trans-\nform the telecom world. On the contrary, however, now neither the CEO nor his\ndeputy had any deep broadband knowledge or experience, and the result was\ndisastrous.\n\n4. Enron was going to stream movies directly into television sets in all homes. Once\nagain, this grandiose plan was not backed by the necessary technology and never\neven approached fruition.\n''"

But before the failures came\nthe hype, and some of the people at Enron—as well as many of the Wall Street financial\nanalysts—actually believed some of the misinformation.\n\nIn January 2000, at a meeting of financial analysts in Houston, Enron and\nSun Microsystems announced that they were going into partnership to focus on\nInternet development. Bryce (2002) explained how the analysts went wild and\nEnron’s stock jumped.\n\nThe stock increase was based on fiction. The technology for most of the plans\nhad not been perfected (or even developed), there were not nearly enough custom-\ners to support the ostentatious plans, and the price of bandwidth would soon plunge.\nBy the second quarter of 2000, Enron Broadband’s revenues were way behind predic-\ntions. However, the accounting and financial problems were “solved” with the help of\nAndrew Fastow’s SPE named LJM2. In his later article in Forbes Magazine, Daniel Fisher\n(2002) explained to readers how Enron had “sold” a portion of its unused fiber to LIM2\nat an inflated price, adding $100 million to Enron’s revenue and about $67 million to\nits profit.\n\nClearly, EBS would not let a little obstacle like the falling price of fiber capacity\nmess up its rosy picture of growth. Soon there would be a way to make real money\nwith broadband. In fact, the Web weavers were already spinning another yarn. In April\n2000, a few months after the formation of Enron Online, EBS had signed a 20-year con-\ntract with Blockbuster. Under this agreement, Blockbuster would persuade the movie\nstudios to give it partnership licensing rights to stream movies directly into private\nresidences, using Enron’s broadband network. The trouble was that Enron had not yet\nworked out the technical details to solve the “last mile problem—getting the content\nfrom Enron’s network into people’s homes” (McLean & Elkind, 2004, p. 292). In addi-\ntion, Blockbuster was having enormous difficulty convincing the studios to cooperate\nbecause there was not much incentive in it for them. All these roadblocks did not stop\nKenneth Lay from announcing in July 2000 that Enron was about to enter the entertain-\nment business.\n\nWithout the technology in place, the Blockbuster project was a disaster and never\nwent beyond a feeble pilot program. The cities in the pilot program were especially\nchosen because they were located in areas where Enron had found small providers\nto solve the problem of moving the movie material from Enron into private homes.\nUltimately, however, even the trial run was a dismal failure. “Broadband executives\nsat in meetings poring over reports of the pilots’ comically pathetic results: the Care\nBears Movie: Seven purchases—$8.40” (McLean & Elkind, 2004, p. 293).\n\nTo deal with the losses from the Blockbuster debacle, Enron decided to spin\na web of SPEs. A variety of these SPEs were used to confuse the situation in order\nto book a profit via a project known as Braveheart. Essentially, Enron persuaded the\nCanadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (CIBC) to finance a deal that appeared to be\na sale of Enron’s share in the 20-year Blockbuster contracts. The contracts were first\n“sold” to a joint venture called nCube and to an SPE called Thunderbird—which,\nin turn, was owned by the Enron entity called Whitewing. The joint venture then\n“sold” the rights to another SPE called Hawaii 125-0 at a price that had wildly off-\ntarget estimates of profits for Enron in the contracts. A few months after recording\nmillions of dollars in profits on the Braveheart project, Enron cancelled its deal with\nBlockbuster.\n\n219\n''"

On July 12,\nit was officially announced that EBS would be merged into Enron’s wholesale division.\nThe EBS farce had caused Enron to lose more than $1 billion.\n\nIn July 2005, several EBS executives were tried on various charges of fraud,\ninsider trading, and money laundering. The jury deadlocked on some charges and\nfound the defendants not guilty on the other charges. The judge “declared a mistrial\non the dozens of counts on which the jury could not agree” (Flood, 2005, July 21). Ben\nCampbell, the prosecutor at this trial, pointed out that “EBS’ highly touted core soft-\nware packages never worked properly and failed to generate much income” (“Enron\nDefendants Not Guilty for Charges,” 2005). This point is actually not in dispute.\nWhat is in dispute, however, is whether or not the senior managers of EBS believed\ntheir own stories. At this particular trial, the defense argued that the EBS executives\nassumed that their network was viable; evidently, the jury was unable to ascertain\notherwise.\n\nLinda Chatman Thomsen, the SEC’s deputy director of the Enforcement Division,\ncommented that the Enron executives “played important roles in perpetuating the fairy\ntale that Enron was capable of spinning straw—or more appropriately, fiber—into\ngold” (qtd. in “SEC Files Amended Complaint,” 2003).\n\nTHE ELECTRICITY FIASCO IN CALIFORNIA\n\nTo comprehend the intricacies of the electricity saga in California, a little back-\nground information is necessary. In the late 1990s, the California Public Utilities\nCommission (CPUC) was in charge of revamping the rules for what was then\nreferred to as California’s electricity deregulation. This, however, was a misnomer,\nas California was really engaged in what amounted to a semi-deregulation of the\nprices that customers paid the utility companies for electricity and the prices that\nthe utilities paid the power companies. The CPUC initiated a 10 percent price cut\nfor the end users and capped the amount paid by the utilities to the power compa-\nnies at $750 per megawatt hour, but did not cap the amount paid for power purchased\nfrom outside California.\nCalifornia’s much-vaunted deregulation contained several other interesting rules:*\n\n¢ The utilities were required to sell their power plants and buy their power on a\ndaily (or even hourly) basis from on-the-spot markets, yet sell the power at the\nfixed reduced rate.\n\n¢ The utilities were required to fulfill their purchasing obligations on existing long-\nterm contracts while selling at reduced fixed rates to customers.\n\n¢ No new long-term contracts were allowed.\n\n¢ The state created two new agencies that were subject to additional rules:\n\n1. The California Power Exchange (CAL PX): Power had to be bought and sold\nthrough CAL PX, which established hourly prices.\n\n2. The Independent System Operator (ISO): When there were emergency energy\nshortages, power had to be purchased and sold though ISO auctions, subject to\n\n \n\n? Information on these rules is from Swartz and Watkins (2003, p. 238), Eichenwald (2005, p. 342), and McLean\nand Elkind (2004, pp. 256, 266).\n''"

ISO\nalso administered California’s electricity transmission lines.\ne If at any time a transmission line’s electricity flow exceeded its capacity, the ISO\nwould pay a premium fee for removal of the congestion.\n\nCalifornia’s energy system was a formula for disaster—even without the perva-\nsive abuse that engulfed it on so many fronts. There were just too many potential prob-\nlems. What if the market price the utilities had to pay for the power went above the\nfixed price at which they were forced to sell the power? Obviously, if that situation\ncontinued too long, the utilities would go bankrupt. If future power prices rose above\nthe $750 cap for power purchased from California, would this be a disincentive for the\nconstruction of power plants in California?\n\nConversely, the cap on customer rates would decrease customers’ incentives to\nuse less power at times when the utilities were paying more for power.\n\nIn addition to all this, some traders and power companies were eager to “game\nthe system” and take advantage of the unintended consequences of this dysfunctional\nset of regulations. For Enron, “[t]he easy money was just too tempting to pass up”\n(Eichenwald, 2005, p. 342).\n\nIronically, California’s bizarre regulations came into effect on April Fools’\nDay—April 1, 1998. While the system worked well at first, the power companies\nand traders soon began to see the potential loopholes. In fact, about a year after the\nnew regulations came into effect, Timothy Belden, former head of Enron’s Western\nenergy trading desk, did an experiment to test weaknesses in California’s power sys-\ntem. On May 24, 1999, Belden negotiated a deal to sell 2,900 megawatts of power to\nCAL PX, and “he identified a transmission route called Silverpeak as the means for\ngetting the electricity to the state” (McLean & Elkind, 2004, p. 268). Silverpeak was\ndeliberately chosen because its lines could transmit only a small amount of electric-\nity, with the result that suddenly, California was facing an energy shortage and had\nto buy a large quantity of power at the last minute when prices increased dramati-\ncally. When the California authorities called Belden to find out whether the choice\nof Silverpeak had been an error, he was blatant that it had been done deliberately.\n\nBy May 2000, all the adverse forces had combined and California’s power night-\nmare began in earnest. A long, dry season reduced the supply of hydroelectricity, and\nthe start of a long, hot summer increased the demand for electric power. The utility\ncompanies were caught in a bind: They were receiving income from the same regulated\nrates from customers, but they were paying astronomical prices for power on the CAL\nPX auctions and the ISO emergency auctions because the utilities had been forced to\nsell their own power plants and had not been allowed to sign any long-term purchase\ncontracts. In addition, there was some suspicion about just how much downtime the\npower plants really needed for maintenance.\n\nBefore May 2000, prices had hovered in the range of $25 — $40 per megawatt hour.\nOn May 22, 2000, the ISO had to declare an emergency as prices “quickly hit the price\ncap of $750 per megawatt hour” (McLean & Elkind, 2004, p. 272). Rolling blackouts\nbegan in June 2000, with schools, companies, and homes experiencing power cuts for\ntwo hours at a time during the day. By the time summer ended, California was expe-\nriencing an energy crisis. In August, the California utilities requested that the Federal\nEnergy Regulatory Commission (FERC) conduct an investigation into trading abuses.\n\n221\n''"

Enron, of course, argued vehemently against price\ncaps on the grounds that it favored market prices—a most disingenuous argument\nbecause these electricity prices were certainly not purely market driven. There was no\nfully deregulated market to produce market prices. Instead, the prices were artificially\ninflated due to manipulations by unscrupulous individuals and a set of dysfunctional\nregulations.\n\nThe artificially high prices in this semi-deregulated market were making much\nmore profit for Enron than market prices ever could. In fact, an October 2002 article in\nthe Wall Street Journal reported that Enron’s “overall electricity-trading profit soared to\n$1.8 billion during 2000 and 2001” (Smith & Wilke, 2002). Back in California, the price of\nelectricity was out of control.\n\nThe jokers at Enron were laughing all the way to the bank. At a conference in\nLas Vegas in mid-2001, Skilling quipped at California’s expense: “What's the difference\nbetween California and the Titanic? At least when the Titanic went down ... the lights\nwere on” (Swartz & Watkins, 2003, p. 267). Skilling chuckled over California’s plight\nwhile schools and companies closed down during rolling blackouts and Pacific Gas and\nElectric filed for bankruptcy.\n\nThroughout this time, emboldened by the Silverpeak experiment, many of the\nother power companies and their traders used numerous ploys to manipulate power\nprices and congestion fees. Those fees enabled the traders to earn more money by\nintentionally sending electricity on congested routes. Furthermore, the sellers could file\ninflated demand schedules to make an electricity line appear to be congested when\nit was not, and the ISO had no way of checking this information. The various bilking\nschemes became so pervasive that they had their own names. For example, making a\nline appear congested became known as “Load Shift” or “Death Star.” An article in the\nSan Francisco Chronicle described the scheme in this way: “To pull off Load Shift, Enron\nsubmitted false schedules to the state’s power grid that appeared to cause transmission\nline congestion, and forced grid officials to pay Enron to relieve the congestion.” The\nsame article described how Jeffrey Richter, an Enron trader, who later pleaded guilty\nto conspiracy to commit wire fraud and making false statements, also assisted in the\ndevelopment of Enron’s “Get Shorty” scheme, which “involved Enron’s selling power\nto the state at high prices in the day-ahead market and then buying it back the next day\nat much lower prices. In company memos, Enron officials admitted the company often\ndid not have the power it was selling and then buying back.” (Quotes from Berthelson &\nMartin, 2003)\n\nAnother loophole pounced upon by unscrupulous suppliers and traders was\nbased on the regulation cap that existed for the price of Californian power—but not for\npower from outside California. The traders simply directed the electricity supplies out\nof California and then redirected it back into the state. Presto! With a wave of a magic\nwand, the power was no longer from California. This dazzling scheme, which became\nknown as “Ricochet,” allowed traders to charge higher prices for out-of-state electricity\n(Eichenwald & Richtel, 2002).\n''"

In October 2002, the Wall Street Journal reported:\n\nTimothy Norris Belden, 35 years old, pleaded guilty to a single count of fraud.\nHe told U.S. District Judge Martin Jenkins in San Francisco that he helped devise\n“schemes” to manipulate the California wholesale electricity market from when it\nwas first deregulated in 1998 until Enron’s collapse in 2001, “because I was trying\nto maximize profit for Enron.” (Smith & Wilke, 2002)\n\nThat same month, another article (in the New York Times) described how Belden\nadmitted to “transmitting energy into a fictional world, complete with bogus trans-\nmission schedules, imaginary congestion in power lines and fraudulent sales of ‘out\nof state’ energy that, in fact, came from California itself.” As a reward for creating this\nfine work of fiction, Enron paid Belden large bonuses, “totaling about $5 million ... the\nseventh-highest amount of bonuses paid to any executive at the company that year.”\n(Quotes from Eichenwald & Richtel, 2002)\n\nErik Saltmarsh, then the executive director of California’s Electricity Oversight\nBoard, was emphatic that Enron did not merely participate in California’s energy\nupheaval, but Enron “was the cause of them” (Peterson, 2005).\n\nAlthough California’s electricity situation emerged from crisis mode in June 2001,\nconcerns about the adequacy of its power supply persist, and the specter of Enron lives\non. In July 2012, an article in the Los Angeles Times discussed a recent Enron-type scheme\nin California’s energy market:\n\nTo the extent it was designed to exploit loopholes in energy trading rules, ... the\nscheme allegedly perpetrated by JPMorgan Venture Energy Corp. is cut from the\nsame cloth as Enron’s infamous “fat boy” swindle, which cost the state’s ratepay-\ners an estimated $1.4 billion in 2002. (Hiltzik, 2012)\n\nThe enormous profit that Enron made on wholesale electricity futures, as well\nas its lucrative trading in natural gas, merely delayed its inevitable downfall from the\nhuge losses it was incurring in the retail electricity business and on projects such as\nDabhol, Cuidba, Azurix, and EBS.\n\nENRON’S FICTITIOUS FINANCIAL REPORTING SCHEMES\n\nAs its plans and projects imploded one after the other, Enron fought to remain afloat\nthe only way it knew: by receiving cash up front in the infamous prepays, reporting\nfalse earnings, and keeping its huge debts off the balance sheet—in short, by fabricating\nits financial statements.\n\nScheme #1: The Abuse of Mark-to-Market Accounting via Mariner Energy\n\nWhen the SEC originally opened the door to mark-to-market accounting in 1991,\nEnron searched for every possible loophole to exploit this opportunity to overstate\nits earnings.

This process involved increasing the asset’s value on the balance\nsheet and increasing the profit on the income statement.\n\nOne of Enron’s most spectacular abuses of mark-to-market accounting involved\nits investment in a private oil and gas exploration company named Mariner Energy,\nInc., that Enron acquired in 1996. If Mariner had been a publicly traded company where\nshares could be sold at a moment’s notice, there would have been valid, objective\nguidelines to use when revaluing Enron’s shares in Mariner. Also, because publicly\ntraded shares can be sold easily (if there is no sale restriction), it would have been fair\nto revalue Enron’s shares in Mariner according to the objective market price and to\nrecognize the corresponding profit (or loss) in the income statement. However, because\nMariner Energy was a private company, it had no verifiable market price. Mariner\nspecialized in highly speculative deepwater exploration, which made the value of its\nshares even more volatile. Nevertheless, the clairvoyants at Enron knew exactly what\nthe shares of this private company were worth. Not surprisingly, the Enron executives\ndeemed the shares to be exceptionally valuable and they became the shares that kept on\nsharing. In fact, one Enron vice president reportedly said that when Enron’s earnings\nwere tight, “People were asked to look and see if there’s anything more we can squeeze\nout of Mariner” (qtd. in McLean & Elkind, 2004, p. 129).\n\nThe SEC, in a subsequent discussion of Enron’s approach to the non-publicly\ntraded businesses in its portfolio, alleged:\n\nEnron valued the businesses according to its own internal “models.” Enron then\nmanipulated these models in order to produce results necessary to meet inter-\nnal budget targets. For example, under the direction of Causey [Enron’s chief\naccounting officer] and others, company personnel fraudulently increased the\nvalue of one of the largest of Enron’s merchant assets, Mariner Energy, Inc., by\n$100 million in the fourth quarter of 2000. (LR 18851)\n\nEnron had acquired Mariner Energy for $185 million and by “the second quarter\nof 2001, Enron had Mariner on its books for $367.4 million” (McLean & Elkind,\n2004, p. 129).\n\nScheme #2: The Abuse of SPEs\n\nThe Powers Report (2002) of the U.S. Congressional Special Investigative Committee\non Enron stated that many of Enron’s transactions involved “an accounting structure\nknown as a ‘special purpose entity’” (p. 5). (A special purpose entity (SPE) is a busi-\nness entity such as a partnership, trust, or joint venture created as legally separate from\na company in order to conduct “special” or specific kinds of business transactions that\nare not part of the company’s normal operating activities.) In accounting terms, if cer-\ntain conditions are met, the SPE’s debt need not be “consolidated” with the company’s\ndebt and its assets are also not added into the company’s consolidated balance sheet.\nBecause such entities operate for a specific purpose, in pre-Enron accounting, the SPEs\nwere allowed to be excluded from consolidation with the sponsor’s group financial\nstatements if the equity interest of a third-party owner was a minimum of 3 percent\nof the SPEs’ total equity capital and an independent party owned the majority of the\n''"

Post Enron, accounting for SPEs\nwas updated by the Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation FIN 46 (R) as\namended by FASB No. 167 (2009). The latest guidance for consolidation is the ASC 810\nproposed update issued in 2011. The Board estimates a final update will be issued in the\nsecond half of 2014.\n\nThe beauty for the unscrupulous sponsoring company is that via equity\naccounting, the company’s share of the SPE’s earnings is accounted for in the com-\npany’s income statement and the company can still record profits on its transactions\nwith the SPE. Under the equity method of accounting, the investor includes its share of\nthe investee’s net income in its income statement and the original cost of the investment\nis increased or decreased by a corresponding amount on the balance sheet. However,\nthere needs to be an arm’s-length distance between the control of the SPE and the com-\npany. The Powers Report (2002) summarized these pre-Enron requirements’ as follows:\n\nA company that does business with an SPE may treat that SPE as if it were an\nindependent outside entity for accounting purposes if two conditions are met:\n\n1. An owner independent of the company must make a substantive equity invest-\nment of at least 3 percent of the SPE’s assets, and that 3 percent must remain at\nrisk throughout the transaction; and\n\n2. The independent owner must exercise control of the SPE.\n\nIn those circumstances the company may record gains and losses on transactions\nwith the SPE and the assets and liabilities of the SPE are not included in the com-\npany’s balance sheet even though the company and the SPE are closely related.\n(2002, p. 5)\n\nThe problem with Enron’s SPEs arose because often the person who managed\nthe SPE was not independent of Enron and often the minimum of 3 percent of equity\ncapital that was purportedly provided by the independent outsider was, in fact, indi-\nrectly provided or guaranteed by Enron. Further, Enron often guaranteed the SPEs’\ndebts. When these facts were revealed, it became clear that the SPEs’ debts should have\nbeen consolidated with Enron’s other debts and this ultimately resulted in Enron being\nforced to restate its financial statements.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, although SPEs often take the form of partnerships, they\ncan also be structured as corporations, trusts, or joint ventures. The charter of an\nSPE limits its activities, while its assets and debts are its own and “off balance sheet”\n(that is—off the sponsor’s balance sheet as long as the sponsor is not at risk for more\nthan its invested capital). Enron used a multiplicity of these kinds of off-balance-\nsheet entities to generate false profits with contrived sales and to keep debt off its\nbalance sheet.\n\nAlthough Enron began its SPE activity as a means to keep a joint venture’s debt\noff its balance sheet, the SPE activity grew to include transactions with the SPEs that\nboth hid debt and overstated Enron’s profits. Eventually, Enron used vast interlock-\ning sets of SPEs to borrow huge amounts of money and to transfer the money to itself.\n\n \n\n*For more information, see page 242 of this chapter.\n\n225\n''"

Enron also\nused the SPEs to overstate earnings via mark-to-market accounting and to recognize\nprofits on the increase in value of Enron’s own shares.\n\nOf course, financial institutions did not lend these huge sums of money to Enron\nwithout receiving guarantees, and eventually, when Enron was called on to repay the\ndebts of the SPEs, the company was bankrupted. By the time Enron collapsed, it had a\nconfusing jumble of over 3,000 interrelated SPEs.\n\nAn examination of six of Enron’s major SPE clusters reveals how Enron deviously\nused these SPEs.\n\nSPECIAL PURPOSE ENTITY #1: JEDI In 1993, Enron entered into an off-balance-sheet\njoint venture with the California Public Employees Retirement System (CALPERS).\nThe joint venture was named JEDI, an acronym for Joint Energy Development\nInvestments, and a tongue-in-cheek reference to Andrew Fastow’s admiration of the\nStar Wars film. Enron’s $250 million was contributed in the form of issuing its own\nshares to JEDI, whereas CALPERS contributed its $250 million in cash. The purpose\nof JEDI was to invest in energy projects. As a legal entity, JEDI could, of course, bor-\nrow cash—and the resulting debt incurred would be JEDI’s debt, not Enron’s. At the\nsame time, Enron could account for 50 percent of JEDI’s profits in its income state-\nment. This particular accounting operation was completely legal; the debt really was\nJEDI’s and not Enron’s. There was no need to consolidate JEDI’s assets and debts\ninto Enron’s balance sheet. It was equally true that 50 percent of JEDI’s profits did\nbelong to Enron and ultimately would be distributed to it or reinvested in JEDI for\neventual distribution to Enron. By the same token, CALPERS had contributed its\n50 percent share of JEDI’s equity.\n\nAt this stage, Enron was not doing any related-party transactions with JEDI,\nwhich was doing its own successful transactions with outsiders. These investments did\nfairly well for Enron and CALPERS. By 1997, the CALPERS half of JEDI was valued\nat $383 million—an increase of $133 million in about four years. At that point, Enron\nwanted CALPERS to enter into a second, even larger joint venture. CALPERS was will-\ning to do this as long as it was bought out of its share of JEDI. Herein lay a problem: If\nEnron purchased CALPERS’ share, it would own 100 percent of JEDI and would have\nto consolidate JEDI’s assets and debts into its group balance sheet, because Fastow\ncould not find another party willing to buy CALPERS’ half of JEDI.\n\nWhile it is difficult to pinpoint exactly when Enron crossed the line from legal to\nfraudulent financial accounting, Fastow’s next step must have been one of the first in\nthat direction: Fastow constructed an SPE to buy CALPERS’ half of JEDI. He named it\nChewco, apparently after the Star Wars character, Chewbacca.\n\nSPECIAL PURPOSE ENTITY #2: CHEWCO There were two major problems facing Fastow\nin financing Chewco as an SPE that could keep its assets and liabilities off Enron’s\nbalance sheet. First, it had to be controlled by someone independent of Enron. Second,\nit had to have a minimum of 3 percent of its equity capital contributed independently\nof Enron. Fastow selected Michael Kopper, an employee at Enron, to be the person\nwho would “independently” run Chewco and purportedly contribute the required\n3 percent of the equity capital—amounting to $11.4 million—to Chewco.

Barclays stipulated that $6.6 million\ncash collateral had to be provided for repayment of the loan; Enron obligingly provided\nthis cash collateral.\n\nThe Powers Report (2002) later concluded:\n\nThe existence of this cash collateral for the Barclays funding was fatal to Chewco’s\ncompliance with the 3% equity requirement.... As a result, Chewco should\nhave been consolidated into Enron’s consolidated financial statements from the\noutset, and because JEDI’s non-consolidation depended upon Chewco’s non-\nconsolidation status, JEDI also should have been consolidated beginning in\nNovember 1997. (p. 52)\n\nIn addition to the feeble attempt to provide outside equity of $11.4 million to satisfy the\n3 percent rule, the remainder of Chewco’s financing came from another $240 million\nloan (which Enron guaranteed) from Barclays Bank, as well as a $132 million advance\nfrom JEDI itself. From this financing, CALPERS was paid $383 million for its 50 percent\nshare of JEDI.\n\nMichael Kopper was now in control of Chewco—a phantom entity. Although\nKopper was not a senior officer at Enron, the fact that he was an Enron employee meant\nit was likely that Chewco would fail the off-balance-sheet SPE test on the grounds that\nChewco was not controlled independently of Enron. This test would have been hypo-\nthetical because Chewco definitely failed the 3 percent outside-equity test anyway. The\nsituation was further complicated by the fact that Kopper later transferred his control-\nling interest to his partner but continued to run Chewco. In fact, Kopper received $1.6\nmillion for managing Chewco.\n\nAccording to the SEC’s ensuing investigation, “Fastow secretly controlled Chewco\nand Kopper, and by virtue of that control, received a share of Chewco’s profits as kick-\nbacks from Kopper” (LR 17762, 2002). The fact that an Enron employee ran Chewco was\nnot revealed to the board of directors and was a contravention of Enron’s own policies\nand procedures guidelines. Moreover, Chewco’s debt was guaranteed by Enron, and as\nsoon as it became likely that any debt guaranteed by Enron would have to be paid by\nEnron, such debt should have been accounted for on Enron’s balance sheets.\n\nChewco and JEDI were significant in two major ways. First, as Bryce (2002)\nexplained, JEDI had to be kept out of Enron’s financial statements. Second, Enron used\nChewco and JEDI to overstate its earnings with related-party transactions—it boosted\nits profits by essentially doing transactions with itself—since JEDI and Chewco were\nreally part of Enron. The Powers Report identified three sources of false earning streams:\n\n1. A guarantee fee;\n2. Management fees;\n3. Revenue recognized on Enron’s own stock.\n\n \n\n* To complicate matters further, these loans were made via a contrived set of transactions with two other enti-\nties: Big River and Little River. Big River was designated as Chewco’s limited partner, and Little River was\nselected to be Chewco’s sole member.\n\n227\n''"

Because neither JEDI nor Chewco\nwere independent entities, this amount was a related-party transaction that, in effect,\namounted to Enron paying itself. Further, Enron recognized the up-front amount of\n$10 million paid in 1997 as revenue for that period instead of spreading the fee for the\nguarantee over the life of the guarantee. In addition, JEDI was required by Enron and\nChewco to pay Chewco a management fee from 1998 to 2003. In 1998, using mark-\nto-market accounting, Enron recognized the present value of the entire five-year peri-\nod’s management fees of $25.7 million in its income statement. The phony fees earned\nby Enron via the management and financing of the bogus entities really amounted to\nEnron managing and financing itself. To bring this wily illusion full circle, we must not\nforget that Enron invested its original $250 million in JEDI in the form of Enron stock.\n\nThe Powers Report (2002) stated that in the first quarter of 2000, “Enron recorded\n$126 million in Enron stock appreciation during that quarter” (2002, p. 59). In effect,\nEnron was actually recording the appreciation of its own stock on its income state-\nment. To add to the cunning subterfuge, when the value of Enron stock owned by JEDI\nfell by approximately $94 million in 2001, “Enron did not record its share of this loss”\n(2002, p. 59). Exhibit 7.1 provides a diagram from the Powers Report showing how\nChewco and JEDI were financed.\n\nKopper and Dodson, who had originally come up with the paltry $125,000 por-\ntion of the $383 million financing for Chewco, also received strangely favorable treat-\nment by Fastow during Enron’s final repurchase of Chewco. The Powers Report (2002)\nstated: “As a result of the buyout, Kopper and Dodson received an enormous return on\ntheir $125,000 investment in Chewco. In total, they received approximately $7.5 million\n(net) cash during the term of the investment, plus an additional $3 million cash\npayment at closing” (2002, p. 64). In addition, Kopper had also received $1.5 million\nin management fees for running Chewco for a few years. The SEC’s Litigation\nRelease No. 17692 (2002) alleged that Kopper “shared the $1.5 million management\nfee with Enron’s CFO”—none other than Andrew Fastow. Furthermore, the same SEC\nRelease claimed that Fastow also “received a share of Chewco’s profits as kickbacks\nfrom Kopper.”\n\nSPECIAL PURPOSE ENTITY #3: LIM1 Emboldened by the ease with which he had manip-\nulated JEDI and Chewco to enhance Enron’s balance sheet, Fastow concocted another\nSPE that he dubbed LJM, a name based on the initials of the first names of his wife, Lea,\nand children, Jeffrey and Matthew. This SPE was registered in the Cayman Islands in\nJune 1999 as a Limited Partnership officially named LJM Cayman L.P., but was subse-\nquently referred to as LJM1.\n\nThe Powers Report (2002) described how Fastow concealed and disguised the\nownership of LJM1 with a series of interlocking partnerships: “Fastow became the sole\nand managing member of LJM Partners, LLC, which was the general partner of LIM\nPartners, L.P. This, in turn, was the general partner of LJM1” (p. 69). Exhibit 7.2 pro-\nvides a diagram of the LJM1 structure.\n\nBy this time, Fastow had realized that he had complete control of the cash bor-\nrowed by an SPE, and the golden goose was his for the plucking. He persuaded Lay\nand Skilling to convince the board of directors to appoint him as general partner of\nLJM1. Fastow offered to invest $1 million of his own cash into LJM1, with a further\n''"

Any worries the\nboard may have had about a conflict of interests must have been put to rest when\nFastow assured them that his participation as managing partner of LIM1 would not\n“adversely affect the interests of Enron” (Powers Report, 2002, p. 69). At the Enron\nboard meeting on June 28, 1999, the directors agreed to waive Enron’s own ethics\nrule—which was supposed to prevent officers of the company from doing business\nwith the company—and approved the formation of LJM1 to be controlled by Enron’s\nown CFO, Andrew Fastow.\n\nThe Enron board’s approval of an arrangement with such potential for disaster\nwas astonishing. Fastow now had an ownership interest in LJM1, and he could get\nfinancing for the SPE via Enron’s stock and Enron’s guarantees of loans. Furthermore,\nhe could buy and sell Enron’s assets via LJM1. Did it not occur to any members of the\nboard that the profits that Enron would record on sales to LIM1 would be absolutely\nmeaningless? Did it not occur to them that Fastow had a large interest in getting Enron\nto guarantee numerous loans for LJM1 in order to acquire substantial amounts of cash\nthat could be used for his own gain? Or that he could start buying and selling Enron’s\nassets at prices more favorable to LJM1 than to Enron? It certainly must have occurred\nto Fastow. This was perhaps why he ensured that the trails to the ownership and financ-\ning of his SPEs were as complicated and convoluted as possible.\n\nEssentially, via contrived sales with an SPE, Enron gave itself revenue that would\nsimply be eliminated upon consolidation of the SPE’s financial statements with Enron’s\n''"

Did Fastow know that an SPE had to be consolidated with the parent\ncompany if it was controlled by a senior officer of that company? He appeared to have\nforged ahead blatantly, without consolidating LJM1 into Enron’s financial statements,\nin direct contravention of conventional accounting practice.\n\nThe hidden problem at the heart of this accounting fantasy was that Enron secretly\nhad to guarantee the SPE’s debt in order for the SPE to get the loans. Eventually, Enron\nwould have to recognize these secret debts when it was forced to pay them. This, how-\never, did not seem to bother Fastow whose creation of illusory earnings via LJM1 far\nexceeded his comparatively modest manipulations with Chewco. His dress rehearsal\nwith Chewco had given him practice in the exploitation of SPEs. It had shown him how\neasy it was to create artificial revenue in Enron’s books—simply by charging an amount\n(for example, for a management fee or a contrived sale) to an SPE that he ultimately\ncontrolled. The SPE would then borrow money to pay Enron. With a deft sleight of\nhand, the ensuing debt was the SPE’s debt—and not Enron’s!\n\nLJM1 and Rhythms NetConnections Enron first used LJM1 to create a false\nput option “hedge” for its investment in Rhythms NetConnections. (A put option is a\nfinancial instrument that gives the owner the right to sell an ownership interest, usu-\nally an equity interest in another company, at a specified price on a specified future\ndate.) The owner of the interest has the option, or choice, to sell the interest at that price\non the future date. The Rhythms transaction was actually the motivation for the for-\nmation of LJM1. Rhythms was an Internet service provider and Enron had purchased\n5.4 million shares of Rhythms NetConnections stock in March 1998 at $1.85 per share.\nIn April 1999, the company went public and the stock jumped to $21 per share, and by\nMay 1999, Enron’s investment was worth almost $300 million. However, Enron was\nnot allowed to trade its Rhythms stock before the end of 1999, and with the wild fluc-\ntuations of Internet companies, it was impossible to estimate what the stock would be\nworth by then. Precisely because of that uncertainty, GAAP rules do not allow a com-\npany to record the profit on such stock until it is marketable. Fastow, however, wanted\nto recognize the profit in Enron’s books immediately—in May. He had to find a way\naround the GAAP rules.\n\nAt that point, Fastow decided that LJM1 would agree to “purchase” the Rhythms\nshares at a specific, profitable price on a future date. Accordingly, the actual amount\nof profit Enron would make on its Rhythms stock in the future would be “known” in\nMay 1999. Because it was now guaranteed that Enron would make that minimum profit\nfrom selling the stocks to LJM1, Enron could use mark-to-market accounting to revalue\nthe Rhythms stock and it could book at least that amount of profit. Fastow ordered\nEnron to buy a put option from LJM1 in May 1999, which would give Enron the right to\nsell its Rhythms stock to LJM1 in June 2004 at $56 per share. This way, if the stock price\nfell by the end of 1999, Fastow reasoned that he did not have to devalue this investment\nbecause he had the right to sell it at $56 per share in June 2004. Enron then went ahead\nin 1999 and “recognized after-tax income of $95 million from the Rhythms transaction”\n(Powers Report, 2002, p. 14).\n\nThe next piece of the puzzle was for Fastow to determine what LJM1 would use\nfor cash to buy the Rhythms stock from Enron. Furthermore, he had to work out how\nLJM1 would handle the loss if the Rhythms shares fell in price. Because LJM1 had\nreceived 3.4 million shares of Enron stock as part of its formation capital, the logic\n\n231\n''"

Did\nFastow ever stop to consider what would happen if the Enron shares held by LJM1\nfell so much in value that the sale of these shares was not enough to purchase the\nRhythms shares at the option price? Fastow probably thought things would never get\nthat bad.\n\nJeffrey Skilling—an ardent supporter of mark-to-market accounting—apparently\nsupported Fastow’s misguided thinking. On the other hand, Vince Kaminski, Enron’s\nchief research analyst (who had an MBA and a PhD in mathematical economics) was\nshocked to discover this hedge maneuver. Allegedly, because Kaminski objected to the\nformation of LJM so vehemently, Skilling transferred Kaminski and his group of ana-\nlysts to other projects. Several years later, at the criminal trial of Lay and Skilling in\n2006, Kaminski explained that using LJM had been like placing bets in a casino that was\nbankrupt. “‘If you lose you lose, and if you win you lose because the house can’t pay\nyour winnings” (qtd. in Mulligan, 2006). The put option hedge would fail if the value of\nboth Rhythms’ and Enron’s shares fell at the same time. When the stock bubble burst,\nthat is, exactly what happened because the “hedge guarantee” that Enron would sell its\nRhythms stock at $56 a share to LJM1 was not a guarantee at all. The so-called “profit”\non the Rhythms stock had not really been earned in May 1999, and Enron could not\nlegitimately recognize the profit in its income statement in 1999.\n\nWhile Fastow liked to obscure the structure of his SPEs, he liked to complicate\ntheir transactions even more. He did not merely arrange for LJM1 to sell Enron the\nput option for Rhythms stock, he also created LJM Swap Sub L.P. and LIM SwapCo\nfor the transaction. He then used LJM1 to transfer $1.6 million of Enron shares and\nabout $3.75 million in cash into LIM Swap Sub. The SPE known as LJM SwapCo was\nmade general partner of LJM Swap Sub. It was actually LIM Swap Sub that issued\nthe put option to Enron, giving Enron the right to sell 5.4 million of Rhythms shares\nto Swap Sub at $56 per share in June 2004. Originally, Enron had issued 3.4 million\nrestricted shares to LJM1. In exchange, Enron received the put option (from Swap\nSub) valued at approximately $104 million, in addition to a note for $64 million.\n\nCommenting on the convoluted, contrived set of SPEs involved in the exchange,\nthe Powers Report (2002) concluded, “We do not know why Swap Sub was used,\nalthough a reasonable inference is that it was used to shield LJM1 from legal liability in\nany derivative transactions with Enron” (2002, p. 81). The complicated structure of the\nRhythms transactions can be seen in Exhibit 7.3.\n\nWith these absurd procedures injected into Fastow’s interlocking SPEs, it is no\nwonder that later, in attempting to unravel it all, Enron’s post-bankruptcy CEO, Stephen\nCooper, declared, “It looks like some deranged artist went to work one night” (gtd.\nin McLean & Elkind, 2004, p. 155). Further, regarding Swap Sub, the CEO of Arthur\nAndersen, which was Enron’s external audit firm, stated in Congressional testimony\non December 12, 2001, “When we reviewed this transaction again in October 2001, we\ndetermined that our team’s initial judgment that the 3 percent test was met was in error.\nWe promptly told Enron to correct it” (Powers Report, 2002, p. 84).\n\nThe Powers Report (2002) went on to explain:\n\nOn November 8, 2001, Enron announced that Swap Sub was not properly capital-\nized with outside equity and should have been consolidated. As a result, Enron\n''"

(p. 84)\n\nIn the first quarter of 2000, Enron decided to sell its Rhythms shares and unwind\nthe Rhythms put option. The period during which the Rhythms stock could not be sold\nby Enron had passed, the stock had fallen in value, and its price continued to be vola-\ntile. According to the Powers Report (2002), Enron analysts had reviewed the financial\nviability of the structure of SPEs created for the Rhythms put option and “determined\nthere was a 68% probability that the structure would default and would not be able to\nmeet its obligations on the Rhythms put” (p. 87)\n\nLJM1 and the Cuidba Power Plant Fastow amused himself with SPEs for sev-\neral years before his maneuvers caught up with him.

This company, also known as EPE,\nwas building the Cuidba Power Plant in Brazil, and Cuidba was meant to connect to a\nnatural gas pipeline that Enron was constructing through tropical forests from Bolivia\nto Brazil.\n\nBy mid-1999, the project had experienced several setbacks. It was far behind sched-\nule and was experiencing opposition from environmentalists who were concerned that\nthe project would harm the tropical forests and delicate ecosystem. Enron wanted to\ndecrease its ownership of this problematic investment. Not surprisingly, no buyer was\nfoolish enough to buy into this messy situation. So what did Fastow do? He conjured\nup a buyer—his own LJM1—and sold a 13 percent stake in Cuidba/EPE to LJM1 for\nthe sum of $11.3 million. (Essentially, Enron sold part of its own share of the Brazilian\n''"

Fastow then concluded that with its\nreduced ownership in Cuidba/EPE, Enron no longer needed to consolidate Cuidba/\nEPE into its financial statements. Further, Fastow decided that Enron now had a market\nprice for the Cuidba project based on the price of “selling” Cuiaba/EPE back to Enron\nitself. In the third quarter of 1997—with circular logic—Enron figured if this 13 percent\nshare that it had sold was worth $11.3 million, then using mark-to-market accounting,\nthe remainder of its share must be worth an extra $34 million in the income statement.\nIn the fourth quarter of 1999, Enron booked another $31 million using mark-to-market\naccounting on a further revaluation of this same plant.\n\nBack in Brazil, Cuidba’s problems worsened for the next few years, but in Texas,\neverything was just swell. Then Enron repurchased LJM1’s stake of Cuidba in August\n2001 for $14 million. Why on earth would anyone have wanted to buy the ailing project\nback when he or she had already “sold” it due to its difficulties? Obviously, the entire\nexercise had been for the purpose of generating some mark-to-market revaluation prof-\nits based on the ludicrous “market value” claim determined by the “outside” sale of\n13 percent of Cuidba/EPE to LJM1. The Powers Report (2002) stated that if Enron had\nagreed to make LJM1 whole (i.e., compensate it for any loss on its investment), “Enron\nwould have been required to consolidate Cuidba/EPE, and could not have recognized\nthe mark-to-market gains” (2002, p. 138). McLean and Elkind (2004) pointed out:\n\n... a June 1999 email from an Enron accountant named Kent Castleman described\nLJM as a “short-term warehouse” for the Cuidba stake. Kopper later disclosed\nthat the buy-back provision had even been included in drafts of the original\nCuiadba sale documents. One thing was certain: the deal provided yet another\nwindfall for LJM’s investors. (p. 203)\n\nAfter the Cuidba deal, Enron began a series of transactions using LJM1 (and later\nLJM2) to purportedly sell poorly performing assets or a share thereof to various SPEs,\nthereby recording profits or avoiding losses on the sales. With these schemes, it was no\nwonder that Enron insider jokes began to circulate referring to Enron’s mark-to-market\naccounting as “HFV” or “Hypothetical Future Value” accounting (McLean & Elkind,\n2004). Fastow also utilized mark-to-market accounting from time to time to revalue\nthe remaining unsold part of the poorly performing assets based on the contrived sales\nand booked more profits on the revaluation of the assets. The strategy was essentially\nfor Enron to use interlocking SPEs as a front to borrow cash from a financial institu-\ntion; then some of the money would be passed on to Enron via the contrived sale of\nEnron’s poorly performing assets to that SPE. (In addition, Enron would generously\nguarantee the loan; so the banks thought that their money was secure!) Cash would\nactually have been loaned to Enron disguised as a sale, thus overstating Enron’s prof-\nits and understating its debt.\n\nThere would be clandestine side agreements to guarantee that the “sold” assets\nwould be repurchased by Enron and that the cash received from the financial institu-\ntions would be repaid. Assets were parked in an SPE with the entire financing arrange-\nment masquerading as a sale when, in fact, it was a loan. The false categorization of the\nloan as a sale overstated both earnings and cash flow in Enron’s financial statements\nand understated its debt.\n''"

Osprey will be discussed\nin more detail later in this chapter, as part of the analysis of Whitewing.\n\nThe Liquidation of LIM1_ To add insult to injury, Fastow hoodwinked a whole\ngroup of individuals in the final winding up of LJM1 and Swap Sub. The two limited\npartners that put up a joint amount of $15 million in the financing of LIM1 were Credit\nSuisse First Boston Bank and National Westminster Bank. Certain employees from the\nbanks allegedly misled their own banks as to the amounts Enron would pay for the\ndismantling of the SPEs. Astoundingly, Fastow constructed yet another SPE, named\nSouthampton, which he controlled and used—together with other Enron employees\nand the banks’ employees—to buy out the interests of Credit Suisse and NatWest in the\nLJM1 set of partnerships. The SEC explained:\n\nIn approximately February 2000, Fastow and others caused Enron to buy out\nthe partnership interests of LJM1’s limited partners, Credit Suisse First Boston\nand National Westminster Bank (NatWest). In connection with this transaction,\nFastow and others told Enron that NatWest wanted $20 million for its interest in\nthe partnership assets, but paid NatWest only $1 million of that sum and pock-\neted the rest. A purported charitable foundation in the name of Fastow’s family\nreceived $4.5 million in proceeds of this fraud. (LR 17762, 2002)\n\nFastow’s audacity was unbelievable, and it did not end there. A few months later,\nin July 2000, Fastow received another $18 million from LJM1. In addition, his “manage-\nment fees” from this SPE came to $2.6 million. According to McLean and Elkind (2004),\n“The Fastows’ total secret take, just from this one partnership, ultimately reached a\nstaggering $25.1 million” (p. 197).\n\nWith LJM1, Enron had overstated its earnings via its related-party transactions,\nhad overstated the cash flow reported in its financial statements, and had falsely driven\nup its stock price. Furthermore, with LJM1, Fastow caught even Skilling and Lay off\nguard with the extent to which he profited from the SPE.\n\nSPECIAL PURPOSE ENTITY #4: LJM2 AND THE RAPTORS The false profits generated by\nLJM1 for Enron, by artificially hedging the Rhythms stock gain, was preparation for\nFastow’s far more ambitious manipulations of earnings with his next SPE creation—\nLJM2. With LJM2, Fastow would not only dramatically expand his overstatement of\nEnron’s earnings, but he would also fatten his own bank balance in various conflict-\nof-interest dealings between Enron and LJM2. Via a series of dizzyingly contrived and\ninterlocking partnerships, LJM2 basically borrowed money—and used Enron’s own\nstock—to purchase poorly performing assets from Enron in order to inflate Enron’s\nearnings, hide its debt, and provide cash to keep Enron going.\n\nPerhaps the most infamous of the LJM2 deals concerned the formation of four\nSPEs called the Raptors (numbered Raptor I through Raptor IV). The Raptors were\ndevised by Fastow and approved by Enron’s board of directors in May 2000. (These\nSPEs were named for the Raptor Golf Course where the scheme was devised, but ironi-\ncally, raptor is also the name of a type of dinosaur believed to have been egg thieves and\n\n235\n''"

Ultimately, “Enron\nused the extremely complex Raptor structured finance vehicles to avoid reflecting\nlosses in the value of some merchant investments in its income statement” (Powers\nReport, 2002, p. 97).\n\nBy way of example, let us consider the convoluted transactions of Raptor I, which\nwas started with the formation of an SPE officially called Talon LLC. (A talon is a vicious\nclaw—another telling choice of name.) According to the Powers Report (2002), LJM2\ninvested $30 million in cash in Talon, and Enron invested “stock and stock contracts\nwith a fair market value of $537 million,” as well as a $50 million promissory note but\nonly $1,000 cash in Talon (p. 100). The $30 million investment by LJM2 was meant to\ncover the 3 percent rule requiring an SPE to have at least 3 percent of its at-risk capital\ncontributed by an independent entity in order for Enron to avoid consolidating the SPE\ninto its own financial statements.\n\nNot surprisingly, there were numerous problems with this devious plan. First,\nLJM2’s $30 million investment in Talon was not at risk, as the SEC later pointed out:\n\nFastow allegedly entered into an undisclosed side deal in which Enron agreed\nthat, prior to conducting any hedging activity with Raptor I, Enron would return\nLJM2’s investment ($30 million) plus a guaranteed return ($11 million). As a\nresult, Raptor I should have been consolidated into Enron’s financial statements.\n(LR 18543, 2004)\n\nGenerally, Talon entered into hedges known as “total return swaps” on interests\nin Enron’s merchant assets. The Powers Report (2002) described these return swaps as\n“derivatives under which Talon would receive the amount of any future gains on the\nvalue of those investments, but would also have to pay Enron the amount of any future\nlosses” (p. 108).\n\nThe main problem was that Talon was really another division of Enron and Enron\nwas just shifting its losing assets to another part of itself; after all, what sort of a busi-\nness would purchase only investments that were on the verge of collapse? Another\nproblem was that Talon’s main asset was its Enron stock, and its fate was inexorably\ntied up with Enron’s fate.\n\nSoon, Enron began parking poorly performing assets in other Raptor structures\nto avoid recognizing losses on those poor investments. Then, of course, the inevitable\nhappened. The assets that had been transferred to the Raptors fell in value, and Enron’s\nstock plunged at the same time. This led to the possibility that Enron would have to\ndevalue the Raptors by $500 million at the end of the first quarter of 2000 and recognize\nthis enormous loss in its financial statements because the Raptors could not meet their\nobligations. Still unwilling to face the reality of extinction, Enron contrived yet another\nstructure to help the Raptors extend their artificial lives a little longer. However, the\nfloundering investments moved to the Raptors continued to fall and Enron’s stock price\ncontinued to decline.\n\nIn the midst of all the tricks, Stuart Zisman, an attorney in Enron’s legal depart-\nment, sent an e-mail to his superiors in September 2001, expressing concern about the\naccuracy of Enron’s financial statements.\n\nZisman’s suspicions were later confirmed. The Powers Report (2002) presented a\ndiagrammatic representation of the complicated set of interlocking structures that were\n''"

Refer to Exhibit 7.4 for a copy of this diagram.\n\nThe Powers Report examined the extent to which Enron used the Raptors to\nmanipulate its reported earnings during the period from the third quarter of 2000\nthrough the third quarter of 2001: “Transactions with the Raptors during that period\nallowed Enron to avoid reflecting on its income statements almost $1 billion in losses on\nits merchant investments.” Without these manipulations, Enron’s pretax earnings for\nthat period would have been “$429 million, a decline of 72%.” Now the writing was on\nthe wall for all to see (Powers Report, 2002, p. 99).\n\nIn the third quarter of 2001, “Enron finally terminated the vehicles.

              "value": "238\n\nChapter 7 ¢ Enron and the Tale of the Golden Goose\n\nas it became clear that Enron’s contingent liability for Whitewing’s debt would become\nan actual liability due to Whitewing’s inability to repay its own debt, Enron’s failure to\nrecord its liability for this debt understated Enron’s own debt.\n\nIn addition, in the event that Whitewing lost money on the resale of the assets\nit had purchased from Enron (at inflated prices), Enron had guaranteed that it would\ncompensate the Whitewing structure with the issue of Enron stock to make up the\nshortfall. This meant that the more Enron’s share price fell, the more shares it would\nhave to issue if Whitewing made losses on the assets it had purchased from Enron.\nPredictably, that is what ultimately happened.\n\nAs always, Fastow and his helpers made the actual flow of money rather difficult\nto follow through a dazzling maze of off-balance-sheet entities. To assist Whitewing,\nan off-balance-sheet share trust entity called Osprey Trust was created and it imme-\ndiately borrowed over $3 billion. Amazingly, no one seemed inclined to ask why in\nthe world any financial institution would lend money to a newly formed trust with no\ntrack record. Surely, the answer would have been obvious: because Enron ultimately\nguaranteed the repayment of the debt. However, Enron’s gatekeepers who reviewed\nthe Whitewing structure and Enron’s financial statements apparently did not ask\nthat question.\n\nAfter borrowing this money, Osprey invested $1.5 billion in the specially cre-\nated partnership of Whitewing Associates. Enron also invested 250,000 shares of its\npreferred convertible stock in Whitewing, as well as $135.2 million of Enron notes.\nWhitewing then paid “$1.6 billion to purchase assets from Enron.” Continuing with its\ntricks, “Enron recorded the proceeds of its sales of assets to the Whitewing Investment\nEntities as cash flow from operating activities.” (Quotes from Bankruptcy Report #2,\n2003, p. 75)\n\nThe Bankruptcy Examiner concluded that the Whitewing Associates should have\nbeen consolidated by Enron, and if this had been the case, the CFFO on the sale of\nEnron’s assets to Whitewing would have been eliminated. In the case of Osprey Trust,\nthe Examiner acknowledged that it was debatable whether or not Osprey should have\nbeen consolidated. However, even without consolidation, the portion of Osprey’s debt\nthat was guaranteed by Enron should have been disclosed in the notes to Enron’s finan-\ncial statements as a contingent liability.\n\nAdding to its impending financial implosion, Enron agreed to issue shares to\ncover losses made by Whitewing’s resale of any assets that it had “bought” from Enron.\nIn another dangerous maneuver, Enron tried to pacify investors by proposing what\nwas, in effect, death-spiral financing—an arrangement in which a borrower agrees to\nrepay a loan amount in the form of the issue of the borrowing company’s own stock.\nThe number of shares issued depends on the market value of the stock on the repay-\nment date. If loans must be repaid by the issue of shares, the more the stock price falls,\nthe more shares have to be issued, which, in turn, drives the stock price down. This is\nsimilar to slicing a pizza into smaller and smaller slices; yes, there are more slices, but\nthey are being reduced to mere slivers.\n\nOriginally, Enron had set up Whitewing and another major share trust entity,\nMarlin, in order to create “in the aggregate, $3.8 billion dollars in off-balance-sheet\nfinancing using support provided by Enron’s preferred stock, related contractual obliga-\ntions of Enron, and Enron notes.” The Examiner concluded that “the Whitewing trans-\naction functioned more like revolving financing with the aggregate amount of advances\n''"

              "value": "Chapter 7 ¢ Enron and the Tale of the Golden Goose\n\nmade by Whitewing entities to Enron over a two-year period exceeding $2.7 billion.”\n(Quotes from Bankruptcy Report #2, 2003, p. 67)\n\nAs Enron’s share price began its inevitable downward spiral, the Whitewing\nstructure—like an albatross—circled back to accelerate Enron’s demise. The Bankruptcy\nExaminer calculated that the remaining assets in the Whitewing structure had “an esti-\nmated aggregate value between $700 million and $1 billion” (Bankruptcy Report #2, 2003,\np. 67). By the end, Whitewing owed $2.43 billion in respect of the Osprey notes.\n\nScheme #3: The Prepay Transactions\n\nEven with all the disguised financing from sales to the SPEs, Enron was still desper-\nately short of cash. Much of the reported earnings was in the form of mark-to-market\naccounting, while many of the losing assets were hidden elsewhere but not actually\nsold. Furthermore, the income from operations reported on Enron’s income statement\nwould be way above the CFFO reported in its statement of cash flows unless something\ndrastic was done to manipulate the CFFO.\n\nEnron, with its usual innovative flair, came up with an answer—or rather, it came\nup with a temporary and rather short-sighted solution known as “prepays.” In essence,\nwith prepays, Enron would enter into a contract with a party to deliver a commodity,\nsuch as gas, in the future at a specified price. That in itself would not have produced any\ncash in a current period, nor should it have produced any profit until the gas was deliv-\nered. However, Enron would sell the contract to a financial institution for the amount\nof the total future cash selling price, less a discount, and Enron would get the cash up\nfront. Presto! The cash problem was “solved,” or at least it appeared to be. However,\nEnron would have to agree to guarantee the repayment of all the cash received, plus\ninterest, at some point in the future.\n\nThe beauty of the scheme for the current period was that Enron was able to\nreport this loan transaction as a sale in its financial statements. It then raised similar\namounts of current assets and current liabilities on the balance sheet under the head-\nings “Assets from Price Risk Management Activities” and “Liabilities from Price Risk\nManagement Activities” with respect to these contracts. To confuse the deals even\nmore, Enron would have a conduit entity agree to deliver the commodities in the future\nand to receive the prepaid cash. The cash would then be paid by the conduit entity to\nan Enron affiliate, usually Enron North America (ENA), which would agree to make\nthe future repayments plus interest. For a diagram of a typical prepay transaction, refer\nto Exhibit 7.5. For a short while, this strategy produced cash and inflated the CFFO\nreported on Enron’s statement of cash flows. It also overstated sales and income and\nkept the long-term debt—which was the true source of the temporary cash inflow—off\nEnron’s balance sheet.\n\nTo illustrate how the prepays worked, Bryce (2002) described one prepay with\nJP Morgan Chase in which Enron entered into a contract to deliver $394 million of\nnatural gas to a customer over the period 2001-2005. Enron sold the contract to the\nconduit, Mahonia—owned by JP Morgan Chase—for $330 million. Enron then agreed\nto buy the full $394 million of gas from another conduit, Stoneville Aegean, and pay for\nit in installments. Enron had just received $330 million cash and had to repay $394 mil-\nlion. In a 1998 e-mail, a Chase banker wrote, “Enron loves these deals ... as they are able\nto hide funded debt from their equity analysts” (qtd. in McLean & Elkind, 2004, p. 160).\n\n239\n''"

In\nJanuary 2003, the Bankruptcy Examiner reached the following conclusions on the pre-\npay transactions:\n\nCollectively, the Prepay Transaction may have been Enron’s single largest source\nof cash during the four-year period prior to the petition date, providing Enron\nwith $5 billion of cash. Yet, Enron’s accounting, cash-flow reporting and disclo-\nsure of transactions were inappropriate. (Bankruptcy Report #2, 2003, p. 66)\n\nFurthermore, the Bankruptcy Examiner concluded:\n\nEnron should have accounted for the Prepay Transactions as debt rather than\nas price risk management activities, and ... Enron should have reported the\ncash received as cash flows from financing activities instead of from operating\nactivities. As a result, the Examiner has concluded that, pursuant to the Prepay\nTransaction, Enron:\n\n¢ Understated its debt by approximately $5 billion in its June 30, 2001 balance\nsheet; and\n\n¢ Incorrectly reported the cash obtained through the Prepay Transactions as\ncash flows from operating activities. (Bankruptcy Report #2, 2003, p. 59)\n\nAccording to the Examiner’s findings, Enron’s cash flow from prepays in 1999\nwas $1.2 billion, which was greater than Enron’s reported total CFFO. The Examiner\nshowed that the Prepays, if properly reported in 2000, would have increased Enron’s\ndebt from $10.2 billion to $14.24 billion. He pointed out, “The prepay technique was\na powerful tool employed by Enron to maintain its investment credit grade rating.”\nIn fact, the Examiner cited William Brown, who managed Enron’s corporate finance\ngroup, as saying that “he understood the amount of any given prepay transaction was\ndetermined by the targeted cash flow Enron wanted to show the Rating pee:\n(Quotes from Bankruptcy Report #2, 2003, p. 62)\n''"

Holdings of less than 20 percent, where the investor has a passive interest in the\ninvestee. The investee’s assets and liabilities are not consolidated into the inves-\ntor’s group balance sheet. Income is recognized when dividends are declared.\n\n2. Holdings of between 20 percent and 50 percent, where the investor is deemed\nto have significant influence, but not control, unless information to the contrary\nexists. These investments are often classified as “investments in unconsolidated\naffiliates” on the balance sheet. The assets and liabilities of the affiliate are not\nconsolidated into the investor’s group balance sheet. The investor accounts for its\nshare of the investee’s income using the equity method.\n\n3. Holdings of more than 50 percent of the equity of the investee, where the investee\nis deemed to have a controlling interest. The investee’s financial statements are\nconsolidated into the investor’s group financial statements.\n\nThe three categories become blurred, however, when investors or sponsors create\nSPEs. SPEs are usually “created by a party (the transferor or the sponsor) by transfer-\nring assets to another party (the SPE) to carry out a specific purpose, activity or series of\ntransactions. Such entities have no purpose other than the transactions for which they\nwere created” (Soroosh & Ciesielski, 2004). They are often partnerships, joint ventures,\nor trusts, and sometimes they are corporations.\n\nIn pre-Enron accounting, because such entities operate for a specific purpose, the\nEmerging Issue Task Force (EITF 90-15) allowed SPEs to be excluded from consolidation\nwith the sponsor’s group financial statements “as long as the equity interest of a third-\nparty owner was at least 3% of the SPE’s total capitalization; at the same time, the major-\nity of equity voting rights cannot reside with the beneficiary” (Soroosh & Ciesielski, 2004).\n\nMany companies began to bend the rules and create entities over which they had\ncontrol, in which they had invested most of the equity capital (except for 3 percent),\nand for which they had further obligations for the entities’ debt. They used the non-\nconsolidation rule to avoid including such SPEs’ debt in their balance sheets and to\navoid eliminating profit on related-party transactions with these entities. These invest-\nments in off-balance-sheet entities were often lost or hidden in the investor’s balance\nsheets as though they were typical investments in unconsolidated affiliates where the\ninvestor holds between 20 percent and 50 percent of the investee.\n\nAs previously mentioned, post Enron, accounting for SPEs was updated by the\nFinancial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation FIN 46 (R) as amended by FASB\nNo. 167 (2009). The latest guidance for consolidation is the ASC 810 proposed update\nissued in 2011. The Board estimates a final update will be issued in the second half of\n\n241\n''"

In essence, under FIN 46(R), if a sponsoring company has an investment in an\nentity that is not self-supportive and there is a possibility that the investor may need\nto provide further financial support, the investee must be defined as a variable interest\nentity (VIE).\n\nVIEs must be consolidated into a company’s group financial statements if the\ncompany is a primary beneficiary of the VIE. The FASB Summary of Statement No. 167\n(2009) identifies the primary beneficiary as:\n\n[T]he enterprise that has both the following characteristics:\n\n1. The power to direct the activities of a variable interest entity that most signifi-\ncantly impact the entity’s economic performance.\n\n2. The obligation to absorb losses of the entity that could potentially be significant\nto the variable interest entity or the right to receive benefits from the entity that\ncould potentially be significant to the variable interest entity.\n\nIn addition, disclosure is also required in the MD&A section regarding certain\ndetails of off-balance-sheet arrangements. The proposed accounting standards update,\nASC 810, “provides criteria for a reporting entity to evaluate whether a decision maker\nis using its power as a principal or an agent. These criteria would affect the evaluation\nwhether an entity is a variable interest entity and, if so, whether the reporting entity\nshould consolidate the entity being evaluated” (FASB News Release, Nov. 2011). It\nis important to note that pre-Enron accounting rules also required many of Enron’s\nunconsolidated SPEs to be consolidated into Enron’s financial statements, but Enron\nfailed to consolidate many of its now infamous SPEs. If some companies broke the old\nrules requiring certain off-balance-sheet entities to be consolidated, some will likely\nbe tempted to break the new rules as well. Therefore, hints in financial statements and\nnotes are instructive for telltale signs of problematic SPEs.\n\nEnron’s SPEs were hidden mainly among its investments in unconsolidated affili-\nates and other investments. Hints were left in references in the notes to the financial\nstatements regarding unconsolidated affiliates and also in the notes regarding related-\nparty transactions, guarantees, and “sales” where some ownership rights in the “sold\nassets” were retained by the seller. There were also vague references, in notes to the\nfinancial statements, to investments in partnerships and trusts and the financing of\nsuch entities with Enron’s own stock.\n\nSIGNAL #1: ASSETS AND LIABILITIES OF UNCONSOLIDATED AFFILIATES OR SPEs\nINCREASING SIGNIFICANTLY When the amount of the assets and liabilities of unconsol-\nidated affiliates or SPEs grows significantly, it is an indication that the company could\nbe using off-balance-sheet entities to hide its debt or overstate its earnings.\n\nIn Enron’s “Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements” in its Annual\nReport, the note titled “Unconsolidated Equity Affiliates” showed that the magni-\ntude of the assets and liabilities of the unconsolidated affiliates was alarming—the\ntotal liabilities grew from $8.3 billion in 1997 to $20.6 billion in 2000. Given that off-\nbalance-sheet entities are often used to hide debt by removing it from a company’s\nbalance sheet, large amounts of debt held by unconsolidated affiliates must raise\nconcern that the company may be liable for the debts of the affiliated entities. There\nshould have been suspicion as to why Enron was investing so much in unconsoli-\ndated entities.\n''"

Be very cautious when notes are unclear as to one or more of the\nfollowing:\n\n¢ The nature of the transactions with the entity;\n\n¢ The reason for using the special entity;\n\n¢ The name of the entity;\n\n¢ The nature of the entity—whether it is a partnership, a trust, a joint venture, or an\nestablished corporation.\n\nWhen investments in unconsolidated affiliates or related-party transactions occur\nwith specially constructed entities such as partnerships, trusts, or joint ventures—as\nopposed to independently established companies—one should be on the alert that the\ncompany could be using SPEs to understate debt and boost earnings. The company\nalso may be blending the disclosure of these SPEs with regular investments in indepen-\ndently established companies. Therefore, users of financial statements must be on high\nalert for unconsolidated affiliates that are described in vague terms.\n\nUnless a company operates in an industry where the use of SPEs is widespread,\nthe financial statements and the MD&A should make very clear the nature of the SPE,\nas well as the reason for its use.\n\nIn an examination of the notes to Enron’s financial statements, the following selec-\ntion of alerts was revealed:\n\n¢ In 1998, Enron’s consolidated balance sheet already showed a $4.433 billion invest-\nment in unconsolidated affiliates. In the related notes, the relationships between\nEnron and some of these affiliates were described briefly, whereas others were not\nnamed or described at all. In fact, $1.199 billion of the $4.433 billion was simply\ndescribed as “other.” The notes also stated, “From time to time, Enron has entered\ninto various administrative service, management, construction, supply and oper-\nating agreements with its unconsolidated affiliates.”\n\nIn the 1998 Annual Report, the note titled “Merchant Assets” stated, “The invest-\nments made by Enron included public and private equity, debt, production pay-\nments and interests in limited partnerships.” (Emphasis added.)\n\nIn the 1999 annual financial statements, several of the LIM SPEs are mentioned\nin the notes under “Related Party Transactions” without using the term special\npurpose entities. It becomes clear that Enron’s own stock was invested in these part-\nnerships from the statement: “LJM received $6.8 million shares of Enron common\nstock.”\n\nAlso in the 1999 notes to the financial statements, an alarming number of new\naffiliates were added to the list of “Unconsolidated Equity Affiliates,” including\nthe now infamous Whitewing structure that hid enormous debt and losses from\nEnron’s financial statements. Vague descriptions were given of the Whitewing\nstructure without a clear rationale for its existence in the first place. (The LJM\nstructure of unconsolidated entities was not even listed in the unconsolidated\naffiliates’ note, although it was mentioned under “Related-Party Transactions.”)\n\n243\n''"

This piece of information\nsheds some light on why the entity was created in the first place and why it was\nshrouded in vagueness in the financial reports. Enron was selling its own assets\nto this affiliated entity. Why would it do that? No rationale was given. (In the\nprevious year, sales of merchant assets to Whitewing had not been mentioned in\nEnron’s unconsolidated affiliates’ note concerning Whitewing.)\n\nBy the time Enron’s 2000 Annual Report was issued, investors should have\nbeen aware of Enron’s investments in the partnerships and joint venture entities of\nWhitewing, LJM, and JEDI, and they should have realized that it was unclear as\nto why and how these entities were being used. This level of vagueness about off-\nbalance-sheet entities should have been a strong alert that Enron may have been\nconcealing something.\n\nSIGNAL #3: UNCONSOLIDATED AFFILIATES USED TO GENERATE SIGNIFICANT\nPROFITS When unconsolidated affiliates—especially constructed entities such as\npartnerships—are used to generate a significant portion of a company’s profit, it is\na signal that the company may be using SPEs to manipulate its financial statements.\n\nA company could be using the SPEs to move poorly-performing assets off its\nfinancial statements to avoid dilution of reported earnings or to generate gains. It is\ntherefore important to search the notes to the financial statements for “gains” or profits\nearned outside of regular operations, especially where such gains appear to have been\nmade in connection with unconsolidated affiliates of the company.\n\nIn Enron’s case, an examination of the “Merchant Investments” notes and\n“Merchant Activities” notes in its annual reports revealed important information\nregarding the sales of Enron’s merchant assets. Refer to Table 7.1 for Enron’s pretax\ngains on sales of merchant assets from 1997 to 2000.\n\nTable 7.2 presents the calculation of Enron’s “Pretax Gains on Sales of Merchant\nAssets” as a percentage of “Operating Income.”\n\nIt is mind boggling to discover that in 1997, without these gains on sales of mer-\nchant assets, Enron’s consolidated operating income of $15 million would have been\nan operating loss of $121 million. It is even more alarming because the “Merchant\nInvestment” note in 1998 shows that the majority of the merchant investments, total-\ning $1.859 billion, were held through unconsolidated affiliates, including partnerships.\n\ni/:\\:}83’8l) Enron’s Pretax Gains on Sales of Merchant Assets*\n\n \n\nYear Amount\n1997 $136 M**\n1998 $628 M\n1999 $756 M\n2000 $104 M\n\n \n\n* Derived from Enron’s Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n** M = million.\n''"

Enron recognized no gains or losses in\nconnection with these transactions.” Whitewing was another unconsolidated Enron\nentity, and here again, Enron was doing transactions with itself and moving assets to\nthis structure. In such a case, one had to wonder whether the reason for this was to\navoid recording large losses.\n\nIn the 2000 Annual Report, the “Related-Party Transactions” note referred to a\n“Related Party” that “acquired approximately $371 million of merchant assets and\ninvestments and other assets from Enron” in 2000. That same Annual Report revealed\nthat Enron had expanded its investment in SPEs to an outrageous degree: “Enron ...\n\n245\n''"

Further, part of the securitiza-\ntion included a related-party transaction with an off-balance-sheet partnership entity\n(Whitewing).\n\nIt is time to sit up and become suspicious when a review of financial statement\nnotes reveals the following:\n\n¢ A company invests significant amounts in unconsolidated SPEs.\n\n¢ That company engages in significant related-party transactions with these entities.\n\ne The transactions include significant securitizations or sales of current assets to\naccelerate cash collections.\n\nThese are clear indications that a company may be sprucing up its reported finan-\ncial statements—and that one cannot rely on the financial statements for analyzing the\nprofit, the cash-flow generation, or the debt of the company.\n''"

With Xerox, the\nCFFO as adjusted for the “sold receivables” revealed that the amount by which CFFO\nlagged operating income was quite alarming.)\n\nIn Enron’s case, the securitizations occurred together with references to related-\nparty transactions, specially constructed entities, and sales where some ownership\ninterests in the “sold” assets were retained by Enron. That combination of factors was\nmore than a signal; it was a siren. It is important to search the 10-Ks and 10-Qs, and to\npay attention to the notes to the financial statements, and to look for the words securiti-\nzation and factoring and for the phrase sales of accounts receivable to pick up this accelera-\ntion of cash flow.\n\nSIGNAL #6: RETAINING PARTIAL OWNERSHIP IN ASSETS SOLD Whena company has\nsales in which it retains any of the ownership interests in the asset sold, it is a signal that\nthe company may actually be obtaining a loan and classifying it as a sale.\n\nWhen such transactions involve off-balance-sheet entities, it is especially trou-\nbling. In Enron’s 1998 Annual Report, the note titled “Merchant Activities” stated,\n“Some of these sales are completed in securitizations in which Enron retains certain\ninterests through swaps associated with the underlying assets.” We now know that\nmany of these sales were, in fact, disguised loans in which the “certain interests” that\nEnron retained were the ownership interests, meaning that the “sales” were actually\nloans. Further, the profit or gains on these so-called sales were included in operating\nincome.\n\nSIGNAL #7: A COMPANY GUARANTEEING THE DEBT OF ITS SPEs Whena company guar-\nantees the debt of its unconsolidated (off-balance-sheet) entities, it is a signal that these\nentities are being used to raise debt and hide the debt by keeping it off the company’s\nown balance sheet and the group’s consolidated balance sheet.”\n\nIn Enron’s 1998 Annual Report, there is a note to the financial statements titled\n“Commitments.” According to this note:\n\nEnron also guarantees the performance of certain of its unconsolidated affiliates in\nconnection with letters of credit issued on behalf of those unconsolidated affiliates.\nAt December 31, 1998, a total of $209 million of such guarantees were outstand-\ning.... In addition, Enron is a guarantor on certain liabilities of unconsolidated\naffiliates and other companies totaling approximately $755 million.\n\nThe growth of Enron’s guaranteed liabilities over the three-year period from 1998\nto 2000 was quite staggering, as can been seen from Table 7.3.\n\n \n\n° In post-Enron accounting, we are less likely to find a disclosure of such a guarantee of an unconsolidated\nentity because such a guarantee would probably lead to the entity being classified as a VIE and to its consoli-\ndation by the entity’s primary beneficiary in terms of FIN 46(R).\n\n247\n''"

Indeed, we now know that the guarantees relating to special\npurpose unconsolidated entities actually bankrupted Enron within one year of the issue\nof its 2000 Annual Report.\n\nGeneral Signals of Enron’s Assorted Financial Problems\n\nEnron’s financial statements revealed warning signs of a variety of financial problems,\nincluding overstatement of earnings, overstatement of CFFO, and problematic debt\nlevels.\n\nSIGNAL #1: ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE INCREASING AS A PERCENTAGE OF REVENUE When\nthe accounts receivable amount increases as a percentage of revenue, it is a signal that\nthe revenue recognized may be accelerated or fictitious.\n\nThis signal becomes an even greater alert if there is evidence (as disclosed in\nnotes to the financial statements) that the company has created SPEs and that the\ncompany is also involved in related-party transactions. In Enron’s case, unrealized\nrevenues were split between accounts receivable and assets from price risk manage-\nment activities (PRMA). The associated revenue from PRMA was specified in the\nnote and included in the category “Other Revenues” in the income statement. Over\ntime, Enron’s accounts receivable and its PRMA grew as a percentage of revenues\nand “other revenues,” respectively. From 1997 to 2000, Enron’s trade receivables\nas a percentage of revenues (excluding Other Revenues) grew from 7.23 percent to\n11.12 percent. Refer to Table 7.4.\n\nSIGNAL #2: CASH FLOW FROM OPERATIONS LAGGING OPERATING INCOME When CFFO\nsignificantly lags behind operating income, it is a signal that the profit generated may\nbe fictitious or that its recognition has been accelerated.\n\nIn Enron’s case, the prepays and securitizations overstated the CFFO dramati-\ncally, so this signal was blurred. Nevertheless, if one had deducted securitizations from\nthe CFFO before comparing it to operating income, the ratio would not have presented\n''"

One dramatic example of this can be found in 1997, when\nCFFO was stated as $211 million, but after adjusting for possible securitizations, it was\nreduced to negative $128 million. For 1999, the effect of the adjustment is even more\ndramatic. For an analysis of these numbers over the four-year period from 1997 to 2000,\nrefer to Table 7.5.\n\nWith these adjustments, the CFFO lagged operating income in each year of the\nperiod from 1997 to 1999, and the CFFO as adjusted was, in fact, negative for two of\nthose years. Of course, we now know that Enron was burning through cash at an amaz-\ning rate while it was pretending to have a healthy CFFO. By 2000, the prepays were\ndisguising the cash-flow problem so heavily that the reported CFFO was positive—and\ngreater than operating income—even after this adjustment. For example, in December\n2000, the Mahonia project produced $330 million of illusory CFFO on one contract alone.\n\nAll the mechanisms discussed earlier regarding Enron’s use of mark-to-market\naccounting, in conjunction with its false sales via SPEs, led to a gap not only between\nreported earnings and generated cash but also to a lack of a strategic business focus on\nprojects that generated real profits and real cash.

Because the financial statements in those years did not specify the amount of the\nsecuritizations portion, it is safest to regard them all as securitizations because these sales were also the\nsales in which “Enron retains certain interests” (Enron Annual Report, 1998). As such, these were sales that\nmay, in fact, have been loans masquerading as sales.\n\n** Tn 2000, the securitizations amount was specified as $2,379 million, which was greater than the amount\nof the sales of merchant assets and investments.\n''"

It was\nnothing we were paid for, so who cares?” (qtd. in McLean & Elkind, 2004, p. 228).\n\nSIGNAL #3: LATE PUBLICATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS When a company is\nlate in publishing its balance sheet and statement of cash flows, it is a signal that\nthe company may be taking time to manipulate these statements because it has\nsomething to hide.\n\nEnron generally issued only its income statement at the time of its earnings\nrelease conference call and made the balance sheet and statement of cash flows avail-\nable much later, when it filed its financial statements with the SEC. The analyst and\nshort-seller Richard Grubman picked up this delay as a signal of problems at Enron.\nWhen Skilling held a conference call on March 22, 2001, in an attempt to allay inves-\ntors’ fears about the $5.06 drop in Enron’s stock price the previous day, Grubman\nquestioned Skilling about the delay. The exchange was heated, with Skilling losing his\ntemper and swearing at Grubman:\n\n[Grubman] pointed out: “You’re the only financial institution that cannot produce\na balance sheet or cash-flow statement with their earnings.”\nSkilling very eloquently responded, “Well, you’re—you—well, uh thank\nyou very much. We appreciate it.”\nGrubman replied, “Appreciate it?”\nWhereupon Skilling snapped, “Asshole.”\n(Qtd. in McLean and & Elkind, 2004, p. 326)\n\nSkilling clearly appeared tense about the cash-flow situation, and Grubman had\nobviously exposed a real problem. Furthermore, Skilling’s angry response to Grubman\nalerted everyone on that conference call to the fact that something sinister lay behind\nthe late financial statements. From then on, analysts and business journalists adopted\nan increasingly skeptical attitude toward Enron’s financial statements.\n\nSIGNAL #4: HIGH INTEREST EXPENSE IN RELATION TO INCOME When the interest\nexpense of a company is so large that it uses a significant portion of its income—or\nwhen interest increases significantly as a percentage of income—it is an indication that\nthe company may not be able to continue to pay its interest and, ultimately, may not\nbe able to repay its debt.\n\nIn Table 7.6, an examination of Enron’s times-interest-earned ratio over the\nperiod 1998 to 2000 clearly reveals that Enron had too much debt. This ratio is used as\na measure of an entity’s ability to meet its interest obligations from the income that it\ngenerates. It is calculated by adding back interest and taxation expense to net income\nand dividing that amount by the entity’s interest expense. Each period this huge debt\nled to large interest expenses relative to Enron’s income. This became a vicious circle\nbecause the company did not produce enough profit to repay its debt—and the debt\nkept growing.\n\nIn spite of that fact that Enron was hiding massive amounts of debt and interest\nvia SPEs, the times-interest-earned ratio extracted from Enron’s reported income state-\nment was, nevertheless, a signal that the company may not have been able to sustain\nits debt with its operating plan.

Of course,\nif a company takes on a large debt and uses that capital to earn profit at a rate of\nreturn that is much higher than the interest rate, it will be a very profitable company.\nHowever, when debt grows substantially and the times-interest-earned ratio does not\nimprove, there is cause for concern that the company will be unable to maintain or\nrepay its debt.\n\nAt Enron, the times-interest-earned ratio remained low while the debt-to-equity\nratio increased even though Enron understated its debt on its balance sheets. In the\nperiod from 1998 to 2000, there was a dramatic increase in the amount of Enron’s capi-\ntal that was financed by debt as opposed to equity, as can be seen in Table 7.7. Over that\nperiod, the debt-to-equity ratio increased from 2.86 to 4.50.

The number of shares\nissued depends on the market value of the stock at the date of the share issue. The\nmost common form of death-spiral financing is a loan in which the terms specify that\nthe amount must be repaid at a specified date by the issue of the borrower’s shares.\nThe problem, of course, is that the lower the stock price falls, the greater the num-\nber of shares that must be issued which, in turn, dilutes the earnings per share and\nreduces the stock price even further, requiring more shares to be issued—and so the\nspiral continues.\n\nIn Enron’s case, as discussed earlier in the sections on Whitewing, LJM, and the\nRaptors, Enron used its SPEs to purchase its poorly performing assets. These SPEs were\npartially funded by the issue of Enron’s shares. In some cases, Enron had guaranteed\nto compensate the SPEs for any losses they may incur on the resale of Enron’s assets\nby issuing additional Enron stock to the entities. In other cases, because the entities\ndepended on their Enron stock as a major asset, Enron had guaranteed that if the Enron\nstock price fell below certain specified amounts, Enron would issue more shares or cash\nto the entities to compensate them. Obviously, this resulted in a further decline in the\nEnron stock price.\n\nSuch death-spiral financing indicates the risk inherent in the potential dilution\nof the value of the shares, and the adoption of the high-risk strategy itself also signals\nthat the company is probably in a desperate position. This should warn the reader that\nthe company may be tempted to hide debt, just as Enron used SPEs to keep what was\neffectively its own debt off its balance sheet.\n\nSIGNAL #7: STRAYING FROM CORE BUSINESS When a company misrepresents the\nnature of its core business or when a large portion of its profit is dependent on a type of\nbusiness that is not its core business, it should be regarded as a signal that the company’s\nability to maintain its earnings is more risky than it wants to disclose.\n\nProfits that are made via trading depend on the volatility of prices and on bet-\nting successfully on the direction of the price changes. Because of the increased risks\ninvolved, investors usually demand a higher earnings-yield percentage for a trading\ncompany than for a hard-asset operating company. Price-earnings ratios are therefore\nusually lower for trading companies than for operating companies.\n\nEnron, while holding itself out as an operating or logistics company, became\nincreasingly dependent on profits from trading, especially in its energy trading sec-\ntor, whose massive profits had, for a time, concealed Enron’s fundamental problems.\n''"

In fact, Enron’s\n2000 Annual Report stated, “We have metamorphosed from an asset-based pipeline\nand power generating company to a marketing and logistics company” (p. 5). The prob-\nlem was that when one excluded the gains from sales of its merchant assets and its trading\nprofits, there was not enough traditional recurring income for its “logistic” operations\nto sustain its stock price.\n\nThe company that had once been regarded as a golden goose was, in fact, a\ncooked goose!\n\nARE THEY LIVING HAPPILY EVER AFTER?\n\ne Timothy Belden (a former head of Enron’s energy trading) pleaded\nguilty “to engaging in a conspiracy that illegally manipulated the California\npower market.” Belden “agreed to forfeit $2.1 million he maintained in two\nbrokerage accounts at Charles Schwab” (Eichenwald & Richtel, 2002). In\nFebruary 2006, Belden appeared as a prosecution witness in the Lay and\nSkilling trial in Houston, Texas. Belden was sentenced (with Jeff Richter) in\nFebruary 2007 to “two years of court-supervised release,” and avoided prison\n(“Two Enron Traders Avoid Prison,” 2007). In 2009, Belden and Richter estab-\nlished an energy consulting company in Portland (“The Defendants of the\nEnron Era,” 2011).\n\nRichard Causey (former Enron chief accountant) entered into a last-minute plea\nbargain agreement toward the end of December 2005, just a few weeks before the\nstart of the trial of Lay and Skilling. Causey “pleaded guilty to securities fraud\nand agreed to cooperate with prosecutors. He was the 16th ex-Enron executive to\nplead guilty” (Hays, 2006). Causey began his prison sentence in January 2007 at a\nminimum-security prison near Austin, Texas (Stinebaker, 2007). He was released\nin October 2011 (Inmate Locator).

The jury found Lay guilty of three counts of securities fraud, one count\nof conspiracy, and two counts of wire fraud. Further, on the same day, “after a\nseparate three-day nonjury trial, US District Judge Sim Lake found Lay guilty of\none count of bank fraud and three counts of making false statements to banks”\n(Mulligan, 2006). In an interview after the trial, jurors revealed that “Lay’s cred-\nibility was severely damaged by evidence that he quietly sold $70 million in\nEnron stock ... in 2001, while telling employees that the company was in fine\nshape and that the stock was a great buy” (Mulligan, 2006). While awaiting sen-\ntencing, Lay died from heart disease during a vacation in Aspen, Colorado, in\nJuly 2006, at age 64 (Pasha, 2006). After Lay’s death, his conviction was expunged\n(Partington, 2012).\n\nRebecca Mark left Enron before its collapse and was not prosecuted. However, in\nearly 2005, Mark “was one of 10 former Enron officers and directors who settled\na lawsuit by shareholders—she contributed $5.2 million of the $13 million settle-\nment” (Lavelle, 2005). She is reportedly the president of an oil and gas consul-\ntancy firm (Partington, 2012).\n\nJeffrey Skilling, 52, went on trial (with Kenneth Lay) in Houston, Texas in\nearly 2006. In May 2006, the jury “convicted Skilling of one count of conspiracy,\n12 counts of [securities] fraud, five counts of making false statements and one\ncount of insider trading. He was acquitted of nine other insider-trading counts”\n(Mullligan, 2006). Skilling was sentenced to 24 years in prison. After hearing an\nappeal in March 2011, the Supreme Court sent Skilling’s case to the 5th U.S. Circuit\nCourt of Appeals in New Orleans to determine whether a new trial was neces-\nsary. The 5th U.S. Circuit ruled against the need for a new trial. In April 2012, the\nSupreme Court rejected another appeal by Skilling (Lattman, 2012). In June 2013,\na deal was made in which Skilling’s sentence was reduced by ten years: “Under\nthe deal, more than $40 million of Skilling’s fortune, which has been frozen since\nhis conviction in 2006, will be distributed to victims of Enron’s collapse” (Hays &\nDriver, 2013).

After reading the Enron chapter and the article below: “Andrew Fastow, Former Enron\nCFO, Talks Ethics with Students,” discuss what you think Fastow’s has learned about\nmaintaining ethical business practices.\n\nb. Do you believe that principles-based accounting standards would be more effective than\nrules-based accounting standards for financial reporting? Give reasons for your response.\n\n \n\nAndrew Fastow, Former Enron CFO, Talks Ethics With Students*\n\nBy Kirk Kardashian\n\nFastow is proof that the road to ignominy is most often not well marked. His talk was part of the\nChoices & Challenges series organized by the Center for Business and Society.\n\nThere was a time, about 13 years ago, when Andrew Fastow had achieved the pinnacle of success and\nfame that could be expected of a chief financial officer. At the tender age of 36, he had been appointed\nthe CFO of Enron, the hundred-billion dollar energy company. Just two years later, CFO Magazine gave\nFastow an award for capital structure management.\n\nBut as the world learned in 2001, the laws of physics don’t apply to fame. When Enron imploded,\ncausing $40 billion in market value to disappear along with the pensions of thousands of people, Fastow\nfell much further than he had ever risen, becoming the most hated person in America. Even his eight-\nyear old son knew the right term for him now. “Dad, you’re not famous,” he said, “you’re infamous.”\n\nFastow, who served more than five years in federal prison for securities fraud, recounted the arc\nof this journey with candor and conciliation to Tuck students on October 8, during an event moderated\nby Richard Shreve, adjunct professor of business ethics at Tuck. The talk was part of the Choices &\nChallenges series on business ethics organized by the Center for Business and Society.\n\nFastow’s story is a perfect case study for business school students on the blurry line between genius\nproblem solving and fraud. The same much-lauded “off-balance-sheet’’ strategies that Fastow innovated to\nmake Enron seem financially healthy were the ones that, upon closer review, landed him in jail. His main\nmistake, he said, was ignoring the principles behind the rules he creatively circumvented. “I used loopholes\nin the rules to get around the principles of the rules,” he explained. “But it’s not always easy to know when\nyou’ re doing that.”\n\nIndeed, it was not as if Fastow acted alone. According to Fastow, every sketchy deal he made was\napproved by accountants, attorneys, and the Enron board—the usual gatekeepers who guard against ille-\ngal action. The salient lesson was that these gatekeepers can also act as enablers. All it takes is a change in\nattitude. Lawyers, instead of warning about fraudulent statements, can delight in crafting disclosures that\nare “technically legal but completely incomprehensible,” Fastow said. Auditors and consultants, instead\nof raising red flags, can help shape the numbers to comply with generally accepted accounting principles.\n\nAnother important lesson was that a series of minor indiscretions can slowly accrete into a major\ncrime. Fastow went astray not with one shocking act of fraud, but by degrees. Time after time, he chose\nfrom a menu of justifications: he was helping shareholders, “it was just a timing problem,” everyone\nwas doing it. “We had a lot of immaterial stuff that added up to being material,” he said. In retrospect,\nthese justifications were just a manifestation of his lack of character, he admitted. Greed, ego, and hu-\nbris all played an underlying role. “I wanted to be a hero by solving the problem,” he said.\n\nWhen the talk became more of a dialogue between Fastow, Shreve, and students, the most daunt-\ning question was how to prevent another Enron-scale disaster, in a business environment where firms\nstill employ legions of people to dream up ways to get around laws. The best hope for reform, Shreve\n\n*Originally published on Oct. 10, 2012, by the Tuck School of Business at Dartmouth. http://www.tuck.\ndartmouth.ed. Published with permission.\n\n255\n''"

The Powers Report later concluded\nthat Chewco “should have been consoli-\ndated into Enron’s consolidated financial\nstatements” because:\n\n(a) The existence of the cash collateral was\nfatal to Chewco’s compliance with the\n3 percent equity requirement.\n\n(b) The SPE had to be controlled by some-\none independent of Enron to avoid\nconsolidation.\n\n(c) Chewco’s activity was not part of Enron’s\nmain operating activity.\n\n(d) Both (a) and (b).\n\nAccording to Enron’s Bankruptcy Examiner,\n\nthe effect of Enron’s “prepay transactions”\n\non its financial statements was:\n\n(a) Understatement of its debt.\n\n(b) Overstatement of its cash flow from operat-\ning activities.\n\n(c) Understatement of its cash flow from\nfinancing activities.\n\n(d) All of the above.\n\nIn respect of its investment in stock in\n\nRhythms NetConnections, Enron used SPE\n\nLJM1 to:\n\n(a) Create a false put option hedge.\n\n(b) Overstate its sales revenue.\n\n(c) Understate its cost of goods sold.\n\n(d) All of the above.\n\nWhich of the following is a signal that a\n\ncompany may be using SPEs to overstate\n\nits earnings or understate its debt?\n\n(a) When references in the notes to the finan-\ncial statements regarding unconsolidated\naffiliates are vague as to the reason for\nusing the SPE, the name of the SPE, or the\nnature of the transactions with the SPE.\n\n(b) When unconsolidated affiliates—\nespecially constructed entities such as\n\n257\n''"

Improper Use of SPEs: The SEC’s\n\nComplaint (2011) against Basin\nWater, Inc. alleged: “The Defendants\nMaterially Overstate Basin’s Q2 2007\nAnd Year-To-Date Revenues By\nEngaging In A Sham $3.8 Million Sale\nTo A Special Purpose Entity They\nDirectly Or Indirectly Cause To Be\nCreated” (section F). After review-\ning the signals for Enron’s schemes of\nusing SPEs to understate debt and to\noverstate earnings, identify the signals\nof the improper use of unconsolidated\n\naffiliates, or SPEs, that were present\nin the Enron case and can allegedly\nbe found in Basin Water’s notes to\nits financial statements. Explain why\nthose signals could have been indica-\ntions that Basin Water may have alleg-\nedly overstated its sales and under-\nstated its loss.\n\nImproper Recognition of Sales: The\nSEC Complaint (2011) alleged that\nBasin also overstated revenues via\ncontingent sales. Further, according to\nthe SEC Complaint, “Several sales did\nnot occur in the quarter for which rev-\nenue was recognized” (par. 3). These\nalleged methods described by the\nSEC are similar to some of Sunbeam’s\nmethods of overstating sales.\n\nReview Sunbeam’s signals of over-\n\nstatement of sales (see Chapter 3) and\nidentify which of those signals could have\nbeen found in an analysis of Basin Water’s\nfinancial statements. Provide supporting\ncalculations.\n\n*In early November, 2013, the bench trial for the Basin Water case was concluded, pending decision by the\ncourt. According to Litigation Release 22014, “In February 2009, Basin Water restated its financial results. In\nJuly 2009, the Rancho Cucamonga, Calif.-based company declared Chapter 11 bankruptcy and is now defunct.\n''"

              "value": "Chapter 8 © Tall Tales\n\nTHE EDISON LESSON\n\nEdison Schools, Inc., is presented here as an example of inadequate disclosures in its\nMD&A.\n\nTaking advantage of problems in public schools throughout the United States, Edison\nSchools, headquartered in New York City, was founded on the premise that private-\nsector corporations could run public schools more efficiently and effectively. Edison\nwas listed on NASDAQ in November 1999. In its early years, Edison managed approxi-\nmately 130 elementary and secondary public schools in about 22 states. It had contracts\nwith public school districts and charter schools to implement its unique curriculum and\nteaching methods, together with a longer school day, in the contracting schools. The\nteachers in the Edison-run schools were the original school district teachers. Edison\nreceived approximately $6,500 per year for each student enrolled at each school, and\nthe teachers usually received compensation that reflected the extra teaching hours\nrequired in the Edison schools.\n\nThe company was usually responsible for the costs of running the schools, but\nthe teachers were often paid directly by the school districts and not by Edison. After\nan investigation into Edison’s accounting methods, the U.S. Securities and Exchange\nCommission (SEC) stated:\n\nThe teacher salaries and non-instruction expenses paid directly by districts (col-\nlectively ’District-Paid Expenses”) comprise a substantial portion of the expense\nof operating Edison schools. These funds never reach Edison, but are expended\nby districts directly and then deducted from the district’s remittances to Edison.\n(AAER 1555, 2002)\n\nPublicly traded companies are required to include a Management Discussion &\nAnalysis (MD&A) section in their financial filings with the SEC. This section serves to\ndescribe the company’s financial health and the results of its operations to help users gain\na better understanding of the company’s financial statements. The MD&A is of particu-\nlar interest and importance because it shows that the disclosure responsibility regarding\nfinancial statements goes beyond a mechanical application of GAAP rules and actually\nrequires an accurate reflection of the company’s financial condition and the results of its\noperations. The SOX Report (2002) stated, “Inadequate disclosure matters may involve\nsituations where the issuer’s financial statements are in conformity with GAAP, but fail\nin some material way to present an accurate picture of the issuer’s financial condition.”\n\nEDISON’S FICTITIOUS FINANCIAL REPORTING SCHEME VIA\nINADEQUATE DISCLOSURE\n\nIn the case of Edison Schools, Inc., the area of inadequate disclosure did not affect\nthe amount of net income at all. The issue was whether Edison could report the gross\namount of the fee per student as its revenues in its income statement and then sepa-\nrately deduct the district-paid expenses or whether it had to report the net payment\nfrom the district (i.e., fees minus expenses) as revenues. Although the net income is\n\n269\n''"

              "value": "270\n\nChapter 8 © Tall Tales\n\nthe same in both cases, the former method could give the impression of a much more\nactive company.\n\nEdison’s practice was to record the gross amount as revenues and include the\ndistrict-paid expenses as its expenses in its income statement. This could present a mis-\nleading picture. For example, in the case of one district (District A) in 2001, no cash\nat all was paid to Edison because, according to the district, the total ’Per Pupil Fees”\namounted to $7.5 million and the district-paid expenses were $8 million in total. In its\nincome statement, Edison “recorded the entire amount invoiced, $7.5 million, as gross\nrevenue for FY 2001, also recording expenses of $8 million” (AAER 1555, 2002).\n\nIn another instance (District B), the SEC alleged that the district “has paid Edison\nonly $400,000 in FY 2002, even though Edison has recorded over $17 million in revenues\nfrom District B for the first two quarters of FY 2002, along with over $18 million in\nexpenses” (AAER 1555, 2002). In May 2002, the SEC issued a cease-and-desist order.’\n\nWhether a company has zero revenue and zero expense or positive revenue and\nan equally positive expense—leading to zero net income—can influence an investor's\nor lender’s perception of the company’s results and financial position.\n\nIn the case of Edison, the SEC alleged: “In its filings with the Commission, Edison\nhas not disclosed the existence and amounts of these District-Paid Expenses. Instead,\nEdison has inaccurately stated in its Management Discussion and Analysis [MD&A]\nthat it ‘receives’ all Per Pupil Funding” (AAER 1555, 2002).\n\nIt is important to note that the SEC acknowledged that at the time of Edison’s\naccounting treatment of these items in 2001, it was not clear that the revenue in the\nincome statement needed to be reported net of the district-paid expenses for those\ncases in which Edison was not the primary obligor. (A primary obligor is the party\nthat has the ultimate responsibility to pay a vendor or provider of services.) If two or\nmore parties agree with each other that one of them will pay a vendor or provider of\nservices, the party that has the ultimate obligation to the payee for the payment is the\nprimary obligor.\n\nThe Emerging Issues Task Force clarified the situation regarding expenses for\nwhich a company is responsible but does not pay. Under the guidance of EITF 01-14,\nwhich became effective in 2002, the Commissioner stated:\n\nUnder this recent accounting guidance, Edison must report revenue on a gross basis\nto include those District-Paid Expenses for which it is the “primary obligor” for the\nexpense. Where Edison is not the primary obligor for the expenses, Edison must\nreport revenue on a net basis to exclude such expenses. The choice between treatment\nof revenues on a gross or net basis does not affect net income. (AAER 1555, 2002)\n\n(Revenue on a gross basis refers to the amount of revenue an entity earns before\nthe deduction or payment of expenses for which the entity is the primary obligor.)\n\n \n\nEdison consented to the order and to a settlement without admitting or denying any of the findings con-\ntained in the order. As set out in AAER 1555, May 14, 2002.\n\n> Current U.S. GAAP has many industry-specific and transaction-specific rules. A new principles-based,\nconverged revenue recognition standard will be adopted, as explained in Chapter 3 of this text. The FASB\ntentatively requires that the new standard will be effective “for annual reporting periods beginning after\nDecember 15, 2016,” for public companies (Revenue Recognition Project, 2013, p. 15).\n''"

The SOX\nReport succinctly stated Edison’s situation:\n\nThe Commission did not find that Edison’s revenue recognition practices\ncontravene GAAP or that earnings were misstated. However, the Commission\nnonetheless found that Edison committed violations by failing to provide accurate\ndisclosure, thus showing that technical compliance with GAAP in the financial\nstatements will not insulate an issuer from enforcement action. (p. 24)\n\nEDISON'S CHOICE OF ACCOUNTING TREATMENT\n\nThe Edison example involves the choice of an accounting treatment and in this case did\nnot have specific signals. However, it is important for users of financial statements to\nbe aware of different reporting methods and to question why one method was chosen\nrather than another.\n\nThe Edison case is particularly interesting because it clearly reveals the basic pur-\npose and ethical considerations at the core of financial reporting.

Related-party transactions include dealings with\nprincipal shareholders, officers, directors, affiliates, and the relatives of shareholders or\nmanagement.\n\nIn its complaint, the SEC maintained:\n\n¢ From mid-1999 to the end of 2001, Adelphia excluded “billions of dollars in\nliabilities from its consolidated financial statements by hiding them in off-balance\nsheet affiliates.”\n\ne During this time, the company \"falsified operations statistics and inflated\nAdelphia’s earnings to meet Wall Street’s expectations.”\n\ne Since 1998 or earlier, the company “concealed rampant self-dealing by the\nfamily that founded and controlled Adelphia, the Rigas family.” (Quotes from\nBR-6413, 2002)\n\nThe Rigas family allegedly used company funds to purchase costly condomini-\nums, plush holiday accommodation, and luxury cars and even to build a golf course.\nAt his trial in mid-2004, John Rigas was accused of recklessly spending company\nmoney. According to examples given by the prosecutor, Rigas used Adelphia’s funds\nto purchase two Christmas trees for $6,000 and to spend $26 million on 3,600 acres\nof land surrounding his house to ensure that the view would never be obstructed. A\nwitness at the trial described how Adelphia had paid for a lavish family wedding, as\nwell as for a personal trainer and masseur who worked full-time for John Rigas and\nhis sons.\n\nThe SEC named six senior Adelphia executives in its civil complaint; four of the\nsix were members of the Rigas family (John Rigas and his three sons); the other two\nwere James Brown and Michael Mulcahey, both vice presidents of the company.\n\nADELPHIA’S FICTITIOUS FINANCIAL REPORTING SCHEMES\n\nAdelphia’s schemes involved abuse of related-party transactions involving members of\nthe Rigas family. In addition to misleading financial statements, Adelphia also dissemi-\nnated other misleading information.\n\nScheme #1: Improper Use and Misleading Disclosure of Related-Party\nTransactions\n\nAdelphia used related-party transactions to hide debt, boost earnings, and loot the\ncompany. Most of the offending transactions involved the use of off-balance-sheet part-\nnerships. Highland Holdings, a Rigas family general partnership, and Highland 2000,\na Rigas family limited partnership, were two of the “Rigas Entities” used for many of\nthe related-party transactions between Adelphia and the Rigas clan. Dealings between\nAdelphia, the Rigas Entities, and the Rigas family itself became even more complicated\nand obscure by the mingling of funds among the various groups. Adelphia, its subsid-\niaries, and the Rigas Entities all deposited and withdrew cash from a joint cash manage-\nment system called “Adelphia CMS” that was administered by Adelphia.\n''"

              "value": "Chapter 8 ¢ Tall Tales\n\nA brief examination of some of the major irregularities involving Adelphia’s\ntransactions with Rigas Entities, or with members of the Rigas family, will illustrate\nthe need for concern wherever related-party transactions are revealed in a company’s\nfinancial statements.\n\nIssuing Adelphia Shares Directly to Rigas Entities A number of direct place-\nments of Adelphia shares were made to Rigas Entities. An examination of these transac-\ntions illustrates the dangers of a company transacting with entities owned or controlled\nby officers or directors of the company. The SEC claimed that, in October 2001 and\nJanuary 2002, Adelphia made a direct placement to Highland 2000 of $423 million of\nAdelphia class B shares and notes payable. Adelphia simultaneously transferred over\n$423 million of debt off its books and created false documentation for its auditors,\nclaiming that Highland 2000 had paid cash for the securities.\n\nThe SEC’s complaint alleged that the transaction was deceptive mainly for the\nfollowing reasons:\n\n¢ The $423,375,076 in debt was not paid down, but instead was shifted to Highland\nVideo.\n\n¢ Highland 2000 never paid cash for the securities.\n\n¢ Adelphia remained jointly and severally liable for the debt.\n\n¢ Highland Video’s “assumption” of debt was a sham because it never received any\neconomic benefit from it and was not dealing at arm’s length. (BR-6413, 2002)\n\nIn addition, the Commissioner maintained that Adelphia engaged in a number of\nsimilar transactions in which a Rigas entity received the securities, and as a result, while\nexisting debt was taken off Adelphia’s books, new debt was taken on without the new\ndebt being reported on the balance sheet.\n\nSelling Adelphia’s Excess Digital Converters to a Rigas Entity Adelphia had\npurchased an excess inventory of digital converters. In the last quarter of 2001, it sold\n$101 million of this inventory to Highland Video. According to the SEC, Highland\nVideo did not operate a cable service and did not need the digital converters. Adelphia\naccounted for the transaction by reducing its debt by $101 million and crediting inven-\ntory by a corresponding amount.\n\nPurchasing Timber Rights from the Rigas Family According to the Commission,\nAdelphia purchased certain rights, including timber rights, to 3,656 acres of land\nowned by the Rigas family in Potter County, Pennsylvania. The family paid under half\na million dollars for the land, and Adelphia purchased the timber rights to the land for\nover $26 million. A highly unusual clause in the contract stated that the timber rights\nwould “revert back to the owner of the underlying land at either the earlier of twenty\nyears or if the percentage of Adelphia stock held by John Rigas fell below 50% of all the\noutstanding company stock” (BR-6413, 2002). Adelphia’s investors were not informed\nof this contract with the Rigas family.\n\nSelf-Dealing Involving a Golf Course, Personal Margin Loans, and the Use\nof Luxury Condominiums The SEC claimed that Adelphia used approximately\n$12.8 million of its funds to construct a golf course on land owned mainly by the Rigas\nfamily. Again, this use of company funds for the personal benefit of the Rigas family\nwas not disclosed to investors. In addition, the family had sole use of at least four glam-\norous condominiums in the United States and Mexico, all courtesy of Adelphia. The\ncompany also paid over $241 million in “personal margin loans and other debt of the\nRigas family” (BR-6413, 2002).\n\n273\n''"

              "value": "274\n\nChapter 8 ¢ Tall Tales\n\nIn the criminal trial of founder John J. Rigas and his son Timothy Rigas,\n“Prosecutors alleged that the Rigas family siphoned $100 million from Adelphia to\npay for personal extravagances, hid $2.3 billion in debt and systematically deceived\ninvestors about Adelphia’s subscriber growth and its bottom line.” Prosecutors at\nthe trial displayed “more than a dozen allegedly false SEC documents signed by\nvarious family members and receipts for personal expenses, large and small, includ-\ning those for 100 pairs of slippers ordered by Timothy Rigas.” In fact, the prosecutors\naccused the family of using Adelphia as a “private ATM.” (Quotes from Masters &\nWhite, 2004)\n\nScheme #2: Improper Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\n\nNot only are investors interested in information disclosed in the financial statements\nbut they also like to know that a company’s customer base is growing and that the\ntechnical quality of the plant and products is high. This might explain why Adelphia\ndid not restrict itself to misleading financial information, but misrepresented its perfor-\nmance in non-GAAP financial measures as well. (Non-GAAP financial measures are\nmeasures that are not included in the income statement, balance sheet, or statement of\ncash flows from operations that are calculated in accordance with GAAP.) For example,\nin its 10-Ks for 2000 and 2001, the company was accused of misreporting and overstat-\ning the number of its cable subscribers. According to BR-6413, 2002, Adelphia added\nthe following to its list of subscribers:\n\ne 15,000 subscribers of an unconsolidated affiliate located in Brazil.\n¢ 28,000 cable subscribers of an unconsolidated Venezuelan affiliate.\n¢ Customers who received “Powerlink,” Adelphia’s Internet service.\n¢ 6,000 Adelphia home-security subscribers.\n\nTo bump up the numbers even further, apparently Adelphia also added cable\nsubscribers from other Rigas Entities and even included long-distance telephone\nsubscribers as basic cable subscribers.\n\nFurthermore, the SEC maintained that when communicating with investors and\nfinancial analysts, Adelphia misrepresented the extent to which it had upgraded its\ncable plant. The upgrade was initiated to improve the cable plant in two important\nareas: to increase the plant’s ability to transmit signals at greater speeds and to enable\nthe plant to transmit as well as to receive signals from its customers. The phrase that\nAdelphia liked to use for this upgraded capacity was “two-way cable,” but the SEC\nclaimed that the extent of the two-way cable upgrade had been exaggerated. For exam-\nple, the Commission revealed that in a 1999 presentation to potential investors in a\nstock offering, Adelphia had used an “overhead slide that contained a pie chart which\nrepresented that approximately 50% of Adelphia’s cable plant [had been] ‘rebuilt.’ This\nclaim was fraudulent because Adelphia’s cable plant was only approximately 35%\nrebuilt at the time” (BR-6413, 2002).\n\nSIGNALS OF ADELPHIA’S FICTITIOUS REPORTING SCHEMES\n\nA number of signals could have alerted readers to the schemes that Adelphia was using\nto present the company in a more positive light.\n''"

These transactions could be\nused to do any of the following:\n\n¢ Hide the company’s debt.\n¢ Overstate the company’s earnings.\n¢ Loot the company’s assets in favor of the major shareholders, directors, or officers.\n\nPay special attention to the related-party transactions note and study all the com-\npany’s financial statements in search of disclosures of any transactions between the com-\npany and its major shareholders, directors, or company officers (as well as their families\nor affiliates). For example, the SEC pointed out that the footnotes in Adelphia’s Annual\nReport for 2000 disclosed the following: “On January 21, 2000, Adelphia closed the previ-\nously announced direct placement of 5,901,522 shares of Adelphia Class B common stock\nwith Highland 2000, L.P. a limited partnership owned by the Rigas family.” The note\nthen falsely stated that Adelphia had used a portion of this “to repay borrowings under\nrevolving credit facilities.” This was misleading because the debt had simply been moved\nto the Rigas Entities. Even if the information in the notes is misleading, the limited disclo-\nsure often alerts the reader to the fact that related-party transactions have occurred. Such\ntransactions are more likely to be manipulated than are arm’s-length transactions, which\nare transactions between two parties that do not have a relationship (such as a business or\nfamily relationship) with each other. (Quotes from BR-6413, 2002)\n\nSIGNAL #2: MIXING A COMPANY'S ASSETS OR LIABILITIES WITH THOSE OF OTHER\nPARTIES The intermingling of a company’s assets or liabilities with the personal assets\nor liabilities of its major shareholders, officers, or directors is a signal of poor internal\ncontrol. This weakness could be exploited to loot a company’s assets.\n\nIn Adelphia’s Annual Report for 2000, a note referred to members of the Rigas\nfamily who were ”co-borrowers with entities under credit facilities.” A disclosure that\nintermingling occurs among a company’s assets and liabilities and those of its directors,\nofficers, or shareholders should be regarded as an alert that more related-party activity\nmay be occurring than is being disclosed. The disclosure may be the tip of the iceberg\nbecause it could become very tempting for officers or shareholders to use the company\nas its own money machine.\n\nARE THEY LIVING HAPPILY EVER AFTER?\n\ne James Brown, former vice president for finance, “pleaded guilty to conspiracy,\nbank fraud, and wire fraud, [and] was the government’s star witness at trial”\n(Crawford & Dunbar, 2004).

According to the SEC, BellSouth ran into problems with its acquisitions of both\nTelcel (in Venezuela) and Telefonia (in Nicaragua).*\n\nBELLSOUTH’S FICTITIOUS FINANCIAL REPORTING SCHEMES\n\nOne of BellSouth’s schemes involved the use of fictitious documents. Other schemes\nincluded incorrect payments and inaccurate records.\n\nScheme #1: The Use of Fabricated Invoices at Telcel\n\nBellSouth entered the Venezuelan market in 1991 with its acquisition of a minority\ninterest in Telcel, and in 1997 BellSouth increased its investment in Telcel to a majority\nholding. By 2002, Telcel had become the largest wireless supplier in Venezuela and was\nBellSouth’s largest revenue earner in Latin America.\n\nThe SEC alleged that from 1997 to 2000, “former Telcel senior management\nauthorized payments totaling approximately $10.8 million to six off-shore compa-\nnies.” Furthermore, the Commission stated that ”Telcel recorded the disbursements\nin Telcel’s books and records based on fictitious invoices.” These fabricated invoices\nwere for “services” rendered to Telcel, although no such services were ever verified and\nBellSouth was unable to provide any information about these payments or about the\nlocation of the money. (Quotes from AAER 1494, 2002)\n\nThe strength of the FCPA legislation lies in the requirement that companies keep\naccurate books and records. Therefore, it is not necessary to first prove illegal intent\nregarding a payment; a suspicious payment in itself can result in an action. The failure\nto keep proper records is sufficient cause for an enforcement action.\n\nScheme #2: The Use of Inappropriate Payments and the Failure to Keep\nAccurate Records at Telefonia\n\nIn 1997, BellSouth had acquired 49 percent of the shares of Telefonia in Nicaragua, as\nwell as an option to acquire another 40 percent. However, there was a problem with the\noption because Nicaraguan law prohibited foreign companies from holding a majority\nof the stock in a telecommunications company.\n\nIn October 1998, Telefonia hired a lobbyist (at $6,500 per month) who was the wife\nof a Nicaraguan politician who happened to be the chairman of the telecommunica-\ntions legislative oversight committee. This committee had “jurisdiction over the foreign\nownership restriction,” and the chairman’s wife worked primarily “on the repeal of the\n\n \n\n* The SEC issued a cease-and-desist order against BellSouth in which the Commissioner found that “BellSouth\nviolated the books and record provisions and internal accounting contract provisions” (AAER 1495, 2002).\nBellSouth consented to the entry of the order “without admitting or denying the Commissioner’s findings.”\nAs set out in AAER 1495.\n\n277\n''"

Many Krispy Kreme devotees were upset by the sale, and several of the\nfranchisees grouped together to repurchase the company in 1982. The business began to\ngrow on the national level as customers all over America lined up to get their first taste\nof the mouth-watering confection.\n\nThe company’s business model seemed like a dream come true: a product that\nneeded no introduction and a customer base waiting to sample the merchandise. Scott\nLivengood, the CEO of Krispy Kreme, took the company public with an initial public\noffering (IPO) in April 2000 and opened a number of international franchises, with the\nfirst European outlet at the Harrods store in London. Livengood was reportedly such\nan avid fan of the doughnuts that he had a huge cake made entirely of doughnuts when\nhe got married in 2002. Krispy Kreme was constantly mentioned in the media, and even\npeople who had never eaten a doughnut became familiar with the brand.\n\nIn the three fiscal-year span from February 2001 to February 2004, the number of\nstores grew from 58 company-owned stores and 86 franchises to 141 company-owned\nstores and 216 franchises. During this period, the company usually exceeded Wall\nStreet’s expectations, as annual revenue grew from $220 million to $665.6 million. Krispy\nKreme’s stock price “climbed most dramatically of all, from the IPO price of $5.25 per\nshare to a high of $49.37 per share on August 18, 2003” (“Summary of Independent\nInvestigation,” 2005, p. 3).\n\nHowever, things started to turn sour as Krispy Kreme was accused of having\n“sweetened results” in its attempts to keep Wall Street happy (Maremont & Brooks,\n2005). The corporation was beset with problems that ranged from store closures to\nrumors about problematic acquisitions and inaccurate accounting practices. In\nan attempt to shore up the struggling company, Livengood tried to blame Krispy\nKreme’s problems on the growing popularity of low-carbohydrate diets; so the com-\npany announced that it was developing a “sugar-free doughnut” (O’Sullivan, 2005).\nHowever, by May 7, 2004, the stock price had dropped to $22.51 per share and kept\nsliding. The next month, one of several lawsuits was filed against Krispy Kreme, alleg-\ning that it had issued “materially false and misleading statements contained in press\nreleases and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission” (Chimicles &\nTikellis LLP, 2004). In October 2004, the SEC informed the company that it was\nunder formal investigation. That same month, the board of directors set up a ’spe-\ncial committee” to perform an independent investigation into the business practices of\nthe company.\n\nIn the final “Summary of Independent Investigation” (2005), the special commit-\ntee highlighted a number of problematic areas. In its examination of company man-\nagement, the committee members stated, “It appears that Livengood was too focused\non meeting and exceeding Wall Street expectations and gave too little attention to\nestablishing the appropriate tone from the top” (p. 6). The committee maintained that\nJohn Tate, the chief operating officer, was also largely responsible for “failure to set the\nappropriate managerial tone and environment ... ” (p. 6).\n\nIn addition, the investigation uncovered several accounting errors in Krispy\nKreme’s financial statements for 2004. Without these errors, the company would\nnot have been able to meet its aggressive sales and earnings estimates as consis-\ntently as it did. It is important to note that the special committee did not conclude\nthat the accounting errors were intentional, although it noted that “government\n\n279\n''"

The recording of round-trip transactions prior to the reacquisition of the fran-\nchise in which amounts were added to the reacquisition cost of the franchise. This\nscheme of misreporting round-trip transactions is examined further below.\n\n2.

In three separate repurchases of franchise\nrights, Krispy Kreme falsely increased the repurchase price of the franchise.\n\nIn the first round-trip transaction, Krispy Kreme agreed to pay an extra\n$800,000 for the repurchase of a franchise in return for the franchisee agreeing to\npurchase a similar amount of doughnut-making equipment from Krispy Kreme\nshortly before Krispy Kreme repurchased its franchise. The cash for the extra equip-\nment and the equipment itself went on a “round-trip” to the franchisee and back to\nKrispy Kreme. Both sales and franchise acquisition rights (an intangible asset) were\noverstated in the process. According to the SEC, ”Krispy Kreme increased the price\nit paid for the franchise by $800,000, i.e., from $65,000,000 to $65,800,000 in return\nfor the franchise purchasing from Krispy Kreme certain doughnut making equip-\nment” (AAER 2941, 2009).\n\nIn the case of the second round-trip transaction, Krispy Kreme inflated its repur-\nchase price “for the franchise by $525,463, which represented an approximation of the\ntotal of two disputed amounts that Krispy Kreme claimed it was owed by the fran-\nchise” (AAER 2941, 2009).\n\nIn the third round-trip transaction, Krispy Kreme paid a distribution to a for-\nmer franchisee without reducing the repurchase price accordingly. The former fran-\nchise holder immediately transferred the amount “back to Krispy Kreme as payment\nof the management fee” (AAER 2941, 2009). This management fee was an amount\nthat Krispy Kreme had demanded “in consideration for Krispy Kreme’s handling of\n\n281\n''"

While in the case of Adelphia all seven elements appear to have been\nneglected, in your opinion, which three of the elements discussed by di Florio would\nhave been most useful in preventing the improper business practices at Adelphia?\nExplain your answer.\n\nExtract from Speech: Conflicts of Interest and Risk Governance\n\nCarlo V. di Florio\n\nDirector, Office of Compliance Inspections and Examinations*\nNational Society of Compliance Professionals\n\nOctober 22, 2012\n\nEffective Practices for Managing Conflicts of Interest**.\n\nTurning from how regulators approach conflicts to how firms can assess and mitigate\nconflicts, I believe that an effective conflicts risk governance framework includes three\nbroad considerations.\n\n1. The first is that there needs to be an effective process, led by a cross-functional\nleadership team, to identify and understand all conflicts in the business model. These\nconflicts need to be understood both in terms of their practical business implications as\nwell as in relation to relevant legal standards. This includes a recognition that conflicts are\ndynamic, and that in addition to continually scanning for new conflicts, each and every\nconflict that has been identified and addressed needs to be revisited periodically to deter-\nmine if it is still being appropriately controlled in light of new business circumstances,\nchanging customer profiles, new regulatory obligations, etc. For instance, in our exams of\nhow firms protect material non-public information (MNPI) from inappropriate uses, such\nas insider trading, we have observed instances where firm programs lagged behind new\nbusiness strategies that created new sources of MNPI. While the business model evolved,\nthe control framework did not and that exposed these firms to significant risks. It is also\nimportant to risk-assess and prioritize which conflicts of interest present the greatest risk\nto the organization so that resources can be allocated accordingly to mitigate and manage\nthose conflicts effectively both from a compliance risk and reputation risk perspective.\n\n2. The second broad consideration, I believe, is to have a good compliance and\nethics program tailored to address the conflicts of interest the firm has identified and\n\n \n\n*The Securities and Exchange Commission, as a matter of policy, disclaims responsibility for any private\nstatements by its employees.\n** Part III of Speech.

[....] Under the securities laws, registrants are expected to have effective\nwritten policies and procedures to prevent violations of the securities laws, and to peri-\nodically review the adequacy and effectiveness of those policies and procedures. For\ninstance Rule 206(4)-7 under the Investment Advisors Act and Rule 38a-1 under the\nInvestment Company Act establish such requirements for investment advisors and\ninvestment companies. Similar requirements also exist for broker-dealers under FINRA\nrules.’* In my view in order to be adequate and effective these compliance and super-\nvisory policies and procedures must include processes to identify, assess, mitigate and\nmanage conflicts of interest.\n\nIn addition, for reference purposes the U.S. Federal Sentencing Guidelines\n(“Guidelines”) since 2004 have provided helpful guidance on many of the key ele-\nments of an effective compliance program. The 2004 and 2010 amendments to the\nGuidelines, as you know, explicitly require an effective compliance and ethics pro-\ngram as a mitigating factor in determining criminal sentences for corporations. The\nGuidelines list seven factors that are minimally required. I would like to examine each\nof these factors in turn, and explain how I believe it relates to effectively managing\nconflicts of interest. I believe that this analysis is also very germane to whether broker-\ndealers and investment advisers have met their supervisory obligations under the fed-\neral securities laws.\n\nStandards and procedures. The Guidelines look to companies to “establish standards\nand procedures to prevent and detect criminal conduct.” The scope of what this may\nrequire depends on the size of the organization, as the commentary to the Guidelines sug-\ngests, with larger organizations expected to have more formal operations and resources\nthan smaller ones. However, I believe that for any organization, developing a strong\nprocess for identifying and managing conflicts of interest is a key means of preventing\nand detecting not just criminal conduct, but other behavior that may create regulatory or\nreputational risks for the business.\n\nSince new conflicts of interest can arise rapidly as a business grows and evolves, and\nmay become apparent to front-line employees before they come to the attention of more\nsenior managers or control functions, communications about these standards and proce-\ndures are also an opportunity to emphasize to all employees the importance of their role\nin recognizing new conflicts of interest, and their responsibility to elevate such conflicts\nto appropriate control functions. Some firms enhance this process by including conflicts\nassessment within other processes, such as new product or business approval, conduct\ncustomer surveys for potential conflicts, or conduct periodic or ad hoc self-assessments\nof their business practices.\n\nOversight. The second factor is that the organization’s “governing authority” — typically\na board of directors and senior management — is knowledgeable about the content and\noperation of the compliance and ethics program and exercises reasonable oversight with\nrespect to its implementation and effectiveness. In order to complement this oversight,\nsome firms establish standing committees, composed of senior executives and senior\n\n \n\n'SNASD Rules 3010 and 3012, which are incorporated into FINRA’s rulebook, contain comparable require-\nments. In addition, FINRA Rule 3130 requires the CEO of a member firm to certify annually, inter alia, that the\nmember has established, reviewed and tested written compliance policies and supervisory procedures reason-\nably designed to achieve compliance with the federal securities laws.

I believe that, in\nthe financial services world, unremediated conflicts of interest are a leading indicator\nof the types of problems that a compliance and ethics program is intended to root out.\nTherefore, I find it difficult to see how the governance structure of a financial services\nfirm can satisfy this factor unless its oversight includes consideration of the effectiveness\nof the compliance and ethics program in addressing conflicts of interest.\n\nLeadership consistent with effective ethics and compliance program. The third factor\nis that the organization use reasonable efforts to exclude from any position of leader-\nship any individual who has engaged in conduct inconsistent with an effective compli-\nance and ethics program—in other words, that the fox is not guarding the henhouse.\nAgain, in my view it would be difficult for a financial services firm to satisfy this stan-\ndard if any of its business unit heads or senior managers has not shown a commitment\nto proactively identifying and remediating conflicts of interest in the business model of\nthe organization.\n\nEducation and Training. The fourth factor is that the organization take reasonable\nsteps to periodically train and otherwise communicate with its leadership, employees\nand agents about its compliance and ethics program, including its standards and proce-\ndures for implementing the program. It follows from what I have already said that, in\nmy view, this training and other communication should include communication about\nthe responsibilities of everyone in the organization regarding identifying, escalating and\nremediating conflicts of interest. It should be tailored to specific conflicts in the business\nmodel and clearly set forth the governance, risk management and compliance proce-\ndures to mitigate and manage these conflicts.\n\nAuditing and Monitoring. The fifth factor is to take reasonable steps to ensure that\nthe compliance and ethics program is followed, including monitoring and auditing, as\nwell as periodic testing of the effectiveness of the program, and to have and publicize\na system by which employees and agents of the organization can report or seek guid-\nance regarding potential criminal conduct without fear of retaliation. Some firms will\ndiscuss with legal and compliance issues prior to a review and then report on issues\ndiscovered to any designated conflicts review authority. For financial service firms,\nthis auditing, monitoring and testing should, in my view, encompass testing of the\neffectiveness of the organization’s policies and procedures regarding management of\nconflicts of interest.\n\nIncentives and discipline. The sixth factor is whether the organization has appropri-\nate incentives to support the compliance and ethics program, and appropriate disciplin-\nary measures for failing to take reasonable steps to prevent or detect criminal conduct.\nI believe that this factor, especially as it relates to incentives, goes to the heart of many\nproblematic conflicts, since these often may involve incentives that an individual has that\nare inconsistent with duties that he or she owes to the organization, its clients or his or\nher customers.\n\nResponse and prevention. The final factor is whether the organization takes reasonable\nsteps to respond to any criminal conduct and to prevent its recurrence, including making\nany necessary modifications to its compliance and ethics program.

Some firms go further, not only analyzing their weaknesses, but also issues identi-\nfied at other firms so that the same problems do not happen at their establishment.\n\n3. The third consideration, in my view, is that this process for addressing conflicts\nof interest is fully integrated in the firm’s overall risk governance structure. The business\nis the first line of defense responsible for taking, managing and supervising conflicts of\ninterest, like other risks, effectively and in accordance with laws, regulations and the risk\nappetite set by the board and senior management of the whole organization. Key risk and\ncontrol functions, such as compliance, ethics and risk management, are the second line of\ndefense. They need to have adequate resources, independence, standing and authority to\nimplement effective programs and objectively monitor and escalate conflicts of interest\nand other risk issues. Internal Audit is the third line of defense and is responsible for pro-\nviding independent verification and assurance that controls are in place and operating\neffectively to address conflicts of interest. Finally, senior management and the board of\ndirectors need to be engaged. This includes considering the risk that conflicts of interest\npresent throughout key business processes, including strategic planning, capital alloca-\ntion, performance monitoring and evaluation of business units and individual business\nleaders. Some of the more effective practices I have observed include having key risk\nand control functions involved in each of these key processes with senior management\nand the board so they can provide their independent view on how business units and\nindividual business leaders are doing at managing conflicts and promoting a culture of\ncompliance and ethics.\n\nLet me close with a few brief observations for senior managers and independent direc-\ntors. I believe that your role in conflicts management and ensuring a culture of compli-\n\n_ ance and ethics is critically important. At the end of the day, managing conflicts is much\nmore than just having a strong compliance program, although that is obviously critical.\nIt also requires establishing a culture that, regardless of regulatory requirements, does\nnot tolerate conduct that casts doubt on the organization’s commitment to high ethical\nstandards, and that values the firm’s long-term reputation over any possible short-term\nbenefit from exploiting its clients or customers. Former SEC Chairman Richard Breeden\nsaid it best when he stated that ”[i]t is not an adequate ethical standard to aspire to get\nthrough the day without being indicted.”\n\nIn addition, while it is undoubtedly helpful to have certain individuals or groups who\nare tasked with specific roles regarding mitigating conflicts, the responsibility of everyone\nin the organization to identify conflicts and see that they are managed appropriately should\nalways be emphasized. As leaders in your organizations, that responsibility starts with you.\n\nFinally, it is important to think proactively when it comes to conflicts of interest. As\nI mentioned earlier, in the financial services industry, and likely in other types of orga-\nnizations as well, conflicts of interest are continually arising in new forms that need to\nbe addressed aggressively and with vision and foresight. Where conflicts of interest are\nconcerned, eternal vigilance and independent oversight are warranted in order to protect\nan institution’s reputation and brand.\n\n \n\n'° Quoted in Business and Professional Ethics for Directors, Executives and Accountants (2009), available at Google\nBooks.

Finally, Gadel and Skrypek directed the preparation of financial statements that\nmaterially overstated Buca’s pre-tax income as a result of Gadel’s and Skrypek’s scheme\nto meet earnings targets through the improper capitalization of expenses.\n\n2. From 2000 until 2004, Micatrotto, Gadel, and others treated the company as a\nvehicle through which they could obtain money to pay for personal expenses. Under\nGadel and Skrypek’s watch, and often with their direct consent, Micatrotto took advan-\ntage of Buca’s lax accounting culture to improperly obtain reimbursement from Buca\nfor personal expenses totaling nearly $850,000. Gadel and Skrypek approved many of\nMicatrotto’s reimbursement requests, even though they knew, or were reckless in not\nknowing, that some of the requests contained personal expenses. Although Gadel and\nSkrypek knew of Micatrotto’s improper reimbursements and helped prepare Buca’s\nproxy statements, Buca’s proxies never reported the payment of these personal expenses\nas compensation to Micatrotto for the years 2000 through 2003. As a result of Gadel and\nSkrypek’s failure to ensure disclosure of this information, Buca’s proxy statements for\nthe years 2000 through 2003 understated Micatrotto’s annual compensation in amounts\nranging from 27% to 74%.\n\n3. Gadel improperly charged Buca for such things as family vacations and visits\nto strip clubs. Skrypek routinely approved Gadel’s improper reimbursement requests.\nFrom 2000 to 2003, Gadel received more than $96,000 in compensation arising from\nimproper reimbursement requests. As a result, Gadel’s compensation, like Micatrotto’s,\nwas materially understated in Buca’s proxy statements.\n\n4, Micatrotto also participated in a related party transaction that Buca never disclosed\nin its financial statements or proxy statements, despite Gadel’s and Skrypek’s knowledge\nof the transaction. Micatrotto and a Buca vendor bought an Italian villa in 2001 and billed\nBuca for the purchase and for certain improvements to the villa. Gadel and Skrypek knew\nof the purchase and approved payments in connection with the purchase of the villa.\n\n5. Likewise, Buca never disclosed a series of related-party transactions involving\nGadel in its financial statements or proxy statements. In 2000 and 2001, Gadel was a\ndirector and 10% shareholder of a small information technology company that engaged\nin a series of transactions involving Buca that totaled more than $1 million. Skrypek\nknew that Gadel had this ownership interest in the information technology company.\nNonetheless, neither Gadel nor Skrypek ensured disclosure of these related party trans-\nactions in Buca’s financial statements or proxy statements for the years 2000 and 2001.\n\n6. Gadel and Skrypek also directed a scheme to meet Buca’s earnings targets through\nthe improper capitalization of expenses. Buca disclosed in a 2005 restatement that it had\nimproperly capitalized nearly $12 million in expenses from 2000 until 2004, which had\nthe effect of inflating Buca’s reported pre-tax income in amounts ranging between 18.8%\nand 36.9% per year.\n\nJURISDICTION AND VENUE\n\n7.

Gadel is 47 years old and a resident of Eden Prairie, Minnesota. From\n1997 until February 2005, Gadel was the CFO and an executive vice president of Buca.\nGadel announced his resignation from Buca in December 2004, and left the company in\nFebruary 2005.\n\n10. Daniel J. Skrypek is 33 years old and a resident of Rosemount, Minnesota. He\nis a certified public accountant who holds an inactive license to practice in Minnesota.\nFrom 1999 until March 2005, Skrypek was Buca’s Controller. From 2001 until 2005, he\nwas also a vice president of Buca. In addition, Skrypek was Buca’s interim CFO for a\nshort period in 2005. Buca terminated Skrypek’s employment in May 2005.\n\nFACTS\n\n11. Buca is a publicly traded company incorporated in Minnesota in 1996 and head-\nquartered in Minneapolis. Buca is the holding company for two restaurant chains, Buca\ndi Beppo and Vinny T’s of Boston. Buca conducted an initial public offering of its stock in\n1999. Since then, Buca’s stock has been traded on NASDAQ. As a public company, Buca\nis required to file certain documents with the Commission, including annual reports on\nForms 10-K, quarterly reports on Forms 10-Q, and proxy statements. From 2000 through\n2004, Buca also filed with the Commission several S-8 registration statements in connec-\ntion with offerings of its securities. These registration statements incorporated by refer-\nence Buca’s financial statements and certain other Commission filings.\n\n12. Gadel and Skrypek each played a significant role in preparing and ensuring the\naccuracy of Buca’s annual and quarterly reports, financial statements and proxy state-\nments filed with the Commission. Skrypek, as the Controller, created the first working\ndraft of Buca’s Commission filings, including consulting with his staff on the account-\ning numbers contained in those filings. Gadel also reviewed drafts of Buca’s quarterly\nand annual reports, financial statements and proxy statements before they were filed\nwith the Commission. Gadel, along with Micatrotto, had the final authority on the con-\ntent of Buca’s Commission filings. In addition, as an executive officer of Buca, Gadel\ncompleted proxy questionnaires each year in connection with the preparation of Buca’s\nproxy statements. Buca used proxy questionnaires as one means of verifying compen-\nsation and related party transactions involving its executive officers. Gadel signed all\nof Buca’s quarterly and annual filings with the Commission during his tenure as CFO\nand certified the accuracy of Buca’s Forms 10-K, and the financial statements included\nin those reports, for the years 2002 and 2003. Additionally, Gadel and Skrypek signed\nBuca’s management representation letters to Buca’s independent auditors in connection\nwith their annual audits of Buca’s financial statements. Through these management rep-\nresentation letters, Gadel and Skrypek represented, among other things, the accuracy\nand completeness of Buca’s financial statements.\n\n13. Gadel and Micatrotto showed little regard for sound corporate governance\nand helped create an environment that was conducive to fraud. In addition, Skrypek,\nas Controller, facilitated the fraudulent conduct that occurred. For example, from 2000\n''"

During this time, Gadel, Skrypek, and their subor-\ndinates regularly received and approved requests for the reimbursement of personal\nexpenses, including requests accompanied by little or no supporting documentation.\nGadel and Micatrotto took full advantage of the lax culture that they had created by\nregularly billing Buca for a wide variety of personal expenses.\n\nPARAGRAPHS 21-35 FROM COMPLAINT:\n\nUndisclosed Related Party Transactions Between Buca and\nVendor in Which Gadel Had Substantial Involvement\n\n21. Gadel had substantial involvement in High Wire Networks, Inc. (”High Wire”),\na small information technology company that engaged in a series of transactions involv-\ning Buca between 2000 and 2001. High Wire was established in October 2000 by a group\nthat included Gadel and two of the primary owners of EDP, which was one of Buca’s\nmajor information technology vendors. High Wire provided voice-over internet proto-\ncol primarily to companies other than Buca. High Wire ceased operations in late 2001.\nDuring the relevant time period, Gadel was a director of High Wire and had a 10% equity\ninterest in the company. Gadel also was one of the two authorized signatories on High\nWire’s checking account and served as one of High Wire’s Buca contacts.\n\n22. Buca essentially funded High Wire’s operations, despite the fact that High Wire\nprovided most of its services to companies other than Buca. High Wire had its offices in a\nportion of Buca’s office complex and Buca paid nearly $98,000 to build out the office space\noccupied by High Wire. Further, EDP billed Buca for salary payments totaling $1,394,775\nmade to High Wire employees, even though many of these High Wire employees spent\nlittle or no time working for Buca.\n\n23. The transactions discussed in the previous paragraph raised suspicions among\nthe more junior members of Buca’s accounting staff. A Buca assistant controller discussed\nwith Skrypek that these payments appeared to represent related party transactions\nrequiring disclosure. In fact, the assistant controller later met with Gadel and Skrypek\non the issue, and suggested that they contact Buca’s auditors. Gadel, however, stated\nthat there was nothing improper with the relationship and Skrypek agreed. Neither\nGadel nor Skrypek ever took steps to ensure disclosure of the related-party transactions\nbetween Buca and High Wire in Buca’s proxy statements or in its Forms 10-K for the\nyears 2000 and 2001.\n\nThe Financial Fraud Scheme\n\nBackground\n\n \n\n24. As a way for Buca to meet analyst earnings estimates, Gadel orchestrated a\nscheme to inflate income through improper capitalization, which Skrypek helped to exe-\ncute.

Beginning in\n2000, Gadel and Skrypek would preliminarily assess Buca’s financials at the close of each\nquarter and then determine how much income they needed to find” in order to meet\nanalysts’ earnings estimates for Buca. Gadel and Skrypek found a number of different\nways to inflate Buca’s income by decreasing expenses through improper capitalization,\nincluding the ways detailed in paragraphs 25 through 34 below.\n\nSham Donations from Vendors Billed Back to the Company\n\n \n\n25. Buca improperly capitalized at least $713,000 in expenses incurred in connec-\ntion with an elaborate bill-back arrangement with certain vendors. The bill-back scheme\nconcerned an annual conference for Buca store managers called the ’Paisano Partners\nConference.” Buca ostensibly funded the Paisano Partners Conference through con-\ntributions from its vendors. In reality, certain Buca vendors made contributions to the\nPaisano Partners Conference with the express understanding that they could bill the con-\ntribution amount back to Buca. Gadel focused the bill-back scheme on vendors, such\nas construction and information technology vendors, that provided goods and services\nthat, under more appropriate circumstances, could be capitalized. Specifically, the\nBuca vendors involved in the scheme would pay contributions to Buca to help fund the\nPaisano Partners Conferences. These capital vendors would then bill back the amount of\nthe contribution by burying the contribution amount in a subsequent inflated invoice to\nBuca. Buca, in turn, would characterize the inflated invoices as capital expenditures. As a\nresult, Buca effectively capitalized the expense of the conference.\n\n26. Gadel orchestrated the bill-back scheme. For example, he directed Buca’s con-\nstruction manager to request that Buca’s construction vendors make contributions to the\nPaisano Partners Conference and then bill back the contribution amount. Construction\nvendors that participated in the bill-back scheme typically billed for the contribution\namount in vaguely worded change orders and invoices, or inflated project bids. Gadel\nexplained to the construction manager that this arrangement would allow Buca to capi-\ntalize the vendor’s bill-back, and that any Buca vendor with questions about the arrange-\nment could call him directly.\n\n27. Skrypek helped implement this bill-back scheme. Several times, Skrypek\ninstructed employees as to whether certain Paisano Partners contributions should be\nbilled back to Buca through a change order, or whether the amount should be built into\nthe vendor’s bid on a Buca project. Although Buca’s assistant controller raised with\nSkrypek concerns about the vague change orders used by vendors making sham dona-\ntions, Skrypek continued authorizing payment of such orders.\n\nEveryday Repairs and Maintenance\n\n \n\n28. Buca improperly capitalized at least $4.67 million in repair and maintenance\nexpenses, as well as general and administrative expenses. Gadel and Skrypek targeted\nrepair and maintenance expenses as a way to make up the difference between analyst\nearnings expectations and Buca’s preliminary financial results. Gadel and Skrypek\ndirected Buca employees at quarter end to review repair and maintenance account\ninvoices over $1,000 to find invoices that could be capitalized in a sufficient quantity\nto meet an earnings target. Many of the capitalized invoices did not represent properly\n''"

Although a Buca assistant controller advised Skrypek that he was\nuncomfortable with the practice of searching for items to capitalize at the end of each\nquarter in view of earnings targets, neither Skrypek nor Gadel did anything to change\nthe practice. As the scheme went on, the improper capitalization of repair and mainte-\nnance invoices significantly expanded. First, Buca employed a practice of capitalizing\nmost repair and maintenance invoices over $1,000 so that there was no need to review\ninvoices at quarter end for capitalization purposes. Later, at Gadel’s direction, Buca set\nup a capitalization account for invoices under $1,000. Gadel and Skrypek eventually\nallowed Buca accounting employees to put any small repair or maintenance invoice that\nthe company received into this account, regardless of whether the invoice represented a\ncapital expense.\n\nInvoices from Vendors Related To Buca\n\n \n\n29. Gadel and Skrypek also exploited Buca’s unusual relationship with High\nWire and EDP to improperly capitalize expenses. Buca, through Gadel and Skrypek,\nimproperly capitalized at least $1.5 million worth of invoices submitted as part of an\narrangement involving High Wire and EDP. First, EDP billed Buca for salary payments\ntotaling $1,394,775 made to High Wire employees, even though many of these High Wire\nemployees spent little or no time working for Buca. Gadel and Skrypek approved capi-\ntalization of these salary payments despite having no documentation supporting such\naccounting treatment. Second, at Gadel’s direction and with Skrypek’s knowledge, Buca\nused an inflated invoice from EDP to improperly capitalize at least $130,000 of ordinary\nexpenses, including Buca’s monthly telephone bill. Finally, High Wire occasionally sub-\nmitted invoices to Buca in the round amount of $100,000 with no description of the goods\nor services provided. Gadel and Skrypek authorized payment of these vague invoices\nand approved the capitalization of the invoice payments. They did so even though\nBuca’s assistant controller had raised questions with Skrypek about the nature of various\nvaguely worded invoices submitted by High Wire and EDP.\n\n30. Because of his close personal involvement in High Wire, Gadel knew, or was\nreckless in not knowing, that Buca’s payments to EDP for High Wire employee salaries\nand office space were not legitimate capital expenses. Likewise, although Skrypek sus-\npected that Buca might be funding High Wire employees through payments to EDP, he\nsimply authorized payment of EDP’s bills and approved the capitalization of those pay-\nments. As such, Skrypek knew, or was reckless in not knowing, that EDP’s High-Wire-\nrelated charges were not genuine capital expenses.\n\nPayments to Independent Contractors\n\n \n\n31. Buca, through Gadel and Skrypek, improperly capitalized at least $1 million in\npayments to independent contractors. The improperly capitalized payments involved both\nthe mischaracterization of certain Buca employees as independent contractors and the mis-\ncharacterization of the work of genuine independent contractors as a capital expense.\n\n32. Buca improperly characterized certain employees as independent contractors\nso that it could capitalize payments to them. For example, in 2002, a portion of the salary\nof Buca’s assistant controller was capitalized. Skrypek told the assistant controller that\nhe would be an independent contractor for his first three months of employment. Since\n''"

In another example, Buca laid off its vice president of real estate but then imme-\ndiately hired her as an independent contractor. Gadel instructed the assistant controller\nto pay the former vice president of real estate a $100,000 “finder’s fee” for two leases she\nhad previously negotiated. Paying the vice president this way for the lease negotiations\nallowed Buca to effectively capitalize her severance payments.\n\n34. Buca also mischaracterized the invoices of genuine independent contractors as\ncapital expenses. For example, Buca, through Gadel and Skrypek, capitalized payments\ntotaling approximately $572,000 made to an independent contractor who provided permit-\nting services for Buca restaurants, despite having no basis to do so. The invoices from this\nindependent contractor contained no itemization of her time or work. The permitting con-\ntractor’s work mainly concerned the ongoing operations of Buca’s restaurants, expenses\nwhich are not appropriate for capitalization.\n\nMeeting with Gadel About Accounting Abuses\n\n \n\n35. A group of Buca’s senior accounting personnel, including the assistant control-\nler, the tax director, and Skrypek, met with Gadel in June 2003 to confront him about\nsome of the accounting abuses identified above. When questioned about the capitaliza-\ntion of expenses, Gadel acknowledged that some of his accounting methods were aggres-\nsive, but denied any wrongdoing. When asked specifically about relationships with\nvendors like High Wire and EDP, Gadel responded that no problems with these relation-\nships existed. Neither Gadel nor Skrypek took any remedial action based on the issues\nraised at the meeting.\n\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nUNITED STATES\n\nSECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION\nWashington, D.C. 20549\n\nExtracts from FORM 10-K®\nAnnual reports pursuant to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934\nFor fiscal years 2000-2002\n\nBUCA, INC.\nFrom NOTES to Consolidated Financial Statements 2000: Note 9\n\n \n\n9.

Galbraith, p. 90\nThe Great Crash 1929\n\nThe great American dream of homeownership turned into a nightmare in late 2007,\nwhen the housing bubble burst and house prices began to plunge. While many strug-\ngling homeowners were victims of unscrupulous mortgage lenders who had sold them\nseriously flawed loans, some were victims of their own greed and belief in the mistaken\nmyth that the housing market would continue to rise forever. The plunge in house\nprices marked the beginning of the financial recession and the 2008 Wall Street crash\nthat spread its tentacles into the global economy for years to come.\n\nJohn Kenneth Galbraith’s description of the Great Crash of 1929 is equally true\nof what happened on Wall Street in 2008. Galbraith explained that during a specula-\ntive boom, investors purchase an asset not for the fruits of the asset or the use of it,\nbut for the purpose of selling the asset at a higher price. This leads to a bubble, or an\ninflated price for an asset that is not justified on the grounds of its actual value—for\nexample, a share’s price that is not supported by its earnings or a house’s price that is\nnot supported by the rents it could earn. Based on this definition of a bubble, house\nprices in the United States in the early part of the 21st century clearly had foundations\nof sand—or even quicksand.\n\nGalbraith explained that opportunists begin to ignore the reasons behind rising\nprices. He wrote that the world before the Great Crash was “a world inhabited not\nby people who have to be persuaded to believe but by people who want an excuse to\nbelieve” (1997, p. 3). With wry humor, Galbraith observed that indispensable aspects\nof the speculative boom mood include “an inordinate desire to get rich quickly with\na minimum of physical effort” (p. 3). He also noted that once the decision has been\nmade to invest in an asset solely for the reason of selling it at a higher price, the\ninvestor would be best rewarded in a leveraged transaction if the price does indeed\nrise. If an investor puts down 20 percent to acquire 100 percent of an asset and the\nasset increases in price by 100 percent, the investment grows to 1,000 percent of the\noriginal outlay. Galbraith thus viewed leveraged transactions as frequent catalysts in\nboom-bust cycles. Of course, add easy credit—in the form of easy mortgage loans—\nto this recipe, and you have all the ingredients for a spectacular boom-bust cycle. In\n''"

Homes are the foundation upon\nwhich many of our social, personal, governmental, and economic structures rest.\nChildren usually go to schools linked to their home addresses; local governments\ndecide how much money they can spend on roads, firehouses, and public safety\nbased on how much property tax revenue they have; house prices are tied to\nconsumer spending. Downturns in the housing industry can cause ripple effects\nalmost everywhere. (p. 4)\n\nEASY CREDIT: SECURITIZATION\n\nThe housing boom, like most booms, was fueled by easy credit. Homeownership has\nlong been a part of the American Dream, and as such, it has enjoyed a long history of\nstrong support from the federal government.\n\nIn 1938, toward the end of the Great Depression, the Federal National Mortgage\nAssociation—or “Fanny Mae”—was established in order to buy up mortgages that were\nguaranteed by the Federal Housing Administration. After World War II, Fannie Mae\nbought mortgages that were guaranteed by the Veterans Administration. The original\npurpose of Fannie Mae was to stimulate the funding and issue of government-insured\nmortgage loans.\n\nWith the 1968 Charter Act, Fannie Mae took the first step in its dramatic evolution:\nTo facilitate affordable housing, its mandate was expanded to include the purchase of\nregular mortgages that were not government-guaranteed (“Fannie Mae Early History,”\n2004). Fannie Mae was by now a hybrid entity, being a government enterprise as well\nas having shareholders.\n\nIn 1970, the Federal Home Mortgage Corporation—or “Freddie Mac”—was\nchartered by Congress to “to keep money flowing to mortgage lenders in support\nof homeownership and rental housing” (“About Freddie Mac,” 2012). Like Fannie\nMae, Freddie Mac also accelerated the funding and issue of mortgage loans by\nbuying up loans from mortgage lenders, freeing up these lenders to make further\nhome loans.\n\nThis buying up of government-insured loans, as well as uninsured loans, was the\nbeginning of a trend in separating the critical origination of a loan from the continued\nownership of that loan. This trend would eventually be destructively expanded and\nmanipulated to bring the U.S. housing market to the brink of disaster because a lender\nwho sold a loan no longer had a direct interest in future principal and interest payments\non that loan. With the goal of homeownership being an intrinsic part of the American\nmentality, government policy did not end at this level of providing capital for home\n\n303\n''"

Even\nmore capital could be freed up to flow into home loans if Fannie Mae were allowed to\nsell to investors the loans it had purchased from lenders. This process of selling its loans\ncould be accelerated if Fannie Mae were allowed to pool together large quantities of\nloans and sell interests in those loans to investors in the form of securities in a process\nknown as securitization. The 1968 Charter Act gave Fannie Mae the authority to do\nexactly that (“Fannie Mae Early History, 2004”).\n\nIn 1970, Fannie Mae issued the first mortgage-backed securities (MBSs) in the\nUnited States when it sold securities backed by its FHA and VA loan programs and\nguaranteed the payment of principal and interest. (A mortgage-backed security is a\nfinancial instrument that gives the owner an interest in a mortgage loan or a partial\ninterest in a pool of mortgage loans.) Shortly thereafter, Freddie Mac began to sell MBSs\nbacked by regular mortgages. It also guaranteed the principal and interest repayments.\nFannie Mae and Freddie Mac’s mortgage loans enjoyed the support of explicit govern-\nment guarantees! for their FHA and VA loans and implicit guarantees for other loans\non the grounds that they were government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs). GSEs are also\nat times referred to as government-sponsored entities.\n\nThere were regulations that prohibited institutional investors, such as pension\nfunds and insurance companies, from investing in mortgage-backed securities that\nwere not backed by GSEs. As a result, investors had little appetite for free-enterprise\nmortgage-backed securities. In their book examining the history of the financial crisis,\nMcLean and Nocera report: “By June 1983, the government agencies had issued almost\n$230 billion in mortgage-backed securities, while the purely private sector had issued\nonly $10 billion” (2010, p. 13). The Wall Street firms envied the GSEs’ advantage in\nthis lucrative sector and lobbied for what they called “a level playing field.” The result\nof this was the Secondary Mortgage Market Enhancement Act of 1984, which allowed\ninstitutional investors, such as pension funds and insurance companies, to invest in\nnon-GSE guaranteed mortgage-backed securities. However, the Act stipulated that\nsuch low-risk institutional investors could invest in these non-GSE guaranteed securi-\nties only if the securities were rated as eligible for such investments by the rating agen-\ncies. This elevated investors’ trust in the ability of these rating agencies to accurately\ngrade risk. Later, investors learned that this trust was unwarranted. Nevertheless, GSE\nloans still dominated the MBS market.\n\nEASY PROFIT: TRANCHING\n\nOnce Fannie Mae was given permission to buy conventional mortgages and securitize\nthem, “all kinds of new mortgage companies could be formed—companies that com-\npeted with banks and S&Ls [Savings and Loans] for mortgage customers” (McLean &\nNocera, 2010, p. 20). At first, these lenders concentrated on making loans that adhered\nto strict underwriting criteria that were required for the loans to be sold to the GSEs;\nthese loans were known as GSE conforming loans. Soon, however, other mortgage lenders\n\n \n\n' Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, while both public companies, are regarded as having “an implicit government\nguarantee” (Pickert, 2008). In September 2008, Freddie Mac was placed under a conservatorship to be over-\nseen by the Federal Housing Finance Agency. The Treasury purchased $187.5 billion of shares in Fannie and\nFreddie so that they would remain solvent (Shenn, 2013).\n''"

These loans became known\nas subprime loans that could not be sold to GSEs. Subprime loans are loans with a higher\nrisk of default. Originally, the term referred to loans that did not conform to GSE under-\nwriting standards. Over time, the term became vague and generally referred to loans\nwith a higher default risk. In addition, these loans were often second mortgages on the\nsame home, making the LTV ratio even higher and the risk of loss or potential default\neven greater.\n\nIt was in this sector of subprime loans that could not be purchased by the GSEs\nthat Wall Street firms could finally securitize mortgages without competition from the\nGSEs. Wall Street began working on making securitized subprime bonds more appeal-\ning to investors. First, these loans charged borrowers high interest rates to compensate\nfor the higher default risk. Second, the firms began offering letters of credit to guaran-\ntee payment to investors in the event of default by borrowers. In this way, investment\nbanks could provide free enterprise lenders with AA or AAA ratings from the now\npowerful credit-rating firms. This, in turn, allowed the low-risk institutional investors\nto invest in non-GSE mortgage-backed securities.\n\nTo add to the mix, the traders developed the practice of tranching, which refers\nto a process of carving up or separating a pool of mortgages into different classes, or\ntranches, of securities which absorb different default losses. Using tranching, traders\n“could divide the securities they sold into several tranches, each with a different level\nof risk, and of return, for the investor” (Tett, 2009, p. 52). Tranches that absorb the initial\nor most likely default losses are known as junior tranches and usually earn a higher rate\nof return because of their higher risk. The senior tranches generally earn a lower rate of\nreturn. Each of the bonds in a pool of bonds that was securitized had a number of dif-\nferent kinds of risk. For example, there were risks such as interest rate payment default,\nprincipal repayment default, or late payment. Furthermore, via tranching traders could\ncreate securities that paid interest or principal only or made payments on whatever\ninnovative parts of the loans one could imagine.\n\nSecurities backed by seemingly safer parts of the pooled mortgages could earn AA\nor AAA ratings, even if the underlying mortgages as a whole were of a lower grade. The\nratings agencies presumably understood “the intricacies of the hundreds of thousands\nof mortgages inside each security” (McLean & Nocera, 2010, p. 8). The next decade\nsaw dramatic changes in the mortgage industry: “Subprime loans ... increased from\n$35 billion in 1994 to $160 billion in 1999, accounting for 12.5% of all residential mort-\ngages. By 2003, subprime lending was at $330 billion and going strong” (Pridgen, 2005).\nMortgage lenders and investments bankers were making enormous profits selling these\nloans, and investment banks were making money securitizing them.\n\nEASY BANKING: REGULATIONS REPEALED\n\nFollowing the Great Crash of 1929, the Glass-Steagall Act of 1933 had separated com-\nmercial banking from investment banking, preventing commercial banks from trad-\ning in securities. This was intended to keep consumers’ deposits safe from being used\nin riskier investment banking activities and to create a firewall to prevent a finan-\ncial crisis from spreading through both arms of banking. However, in April 1998,\nCiticorp, a commercial bank, merged with Travelers Insurance, which owned Smith\n\n305\n''"

This merger, which was structured to “work around”\nthe Glass-Steagall Act (“The Long Demise,” 2003), resulted in a huge and unwieldy\n“conglomerate ... empowered to sell securities, make loans, underwrite stocks, sell\ninsurance” (McDonald & Robinson, 2009, p. 6). By the following year, the banking\nindustry had successfully lobbied Congress to scrap Glass-Steagall, and in November\n1999, the Financial Services Modernization Act was passed. An opinion piece in The\nEconomist celebrated the repeal of Glass-Steagall:\n\nIt is always good to be rid of bad legislation—and Glass-Steagall was a lousy law\nfrom day one. Implemented in the darkest days of the Great Depression, the act\nplayed to populist beliefs that banks’ securities activities caused the Wall Street\ncrash of 1929 and the economic misery that followed in its wake.... Bankers got\nthe blame. Indeed, they were compared unfavourably [sic] with Al Capone. (“The\nWall Falls,” 1999)\n\nIn hindsight, however, opponents of deregulation often cite the rescinding of\nGlass-Steagall as the biggest single regulatory cause in creating an environment for the\nfinancial meltdown of 2008.\n\nThe combination of minimal regulation, easy credit, and loan securitization\nprovided fertile ground for fictitious accounting on a large scale. As the real-estate\nbubble began to implode, some mortgage lenders, mortgage insurers, and investors in\nmortgage-backed securities overstated earnings by underestimating and understating\nthe allowance for loan losses.\n\nEASY INVESTING: CREDIT DEFAULT SWAPS\n\nWith the repeal of the Glass Steagall Act, the number of new mortgage loans grew\ndramatically, and the securitization of these loans for trading as MBSs began to\nskyrocket. Soon, home loans were pooled with other loans, such as car loans, credit card\ndebt, and student loans, then carved into tranches and securitized by the investment\nbanks into what became known as collateralized debt obligations (CDOs).\n\nAs the mortgage loans being securitized grew increasingly weighted toward loans\nwith higher loan-to-value ratios, or borrowers with poor credit or second loans on the\nsame houses, the banks grew wary of issuing letters of credit guaranteeing the securi-\ntized loans against default. They attempted to hedge their bets. The insurance compa-\nnies stepped in to offer a different kind of derivative to keep the time bomb ticking. A\nderivative financial instrument, or security, derives its value by reference to an asset or\nindex outside of the instrument itself.\n\nFor example, one can invest in a copper derivative security that requires that\nthe holder must be paid an amount determined by reference to the level of a copper\nprice index on a specific date. Insurance companies such as AIG and some investment\nbanks began to write instruments that gave the holder of the instrument the right to\nbe paid if the borrowers of the underlying mortgages backing the MBSs and CDOs\ndefaulted. These derivatives were known as credit-default swaps (CDSs). Wall Street\nlegend has it that the concept of the credit-default swap was developed in 1994 by\nJ.P. Morgan bankers during a company weekend at the luxurious Boca Raton Resort &\nClub in Florida, according to a Newsweek article by Matthew Phillips (2008). Such\n''"

In such a scenario, selling\nCDSs would continue to be very profitable. However, if borrowers defaulted and house\nprices dropped, the CDSs would represent a gigantic liability for the underwriters. The\nbanks alleged that their risks in loans they had securitized and in CDSs they had writ-\nten were offset by their investments in CDSs that were underwritten by other banks\nand insurance companies. The problem was that the banks and insurance companies\ndid not have anywhere near enough cash to make good on the CDSs and insurance\npolicies if house prices dropped and borrowers defaulted.\n\nAs the issuance of mortgages, CDSs, MBSs, and CDOs mushroomed during the\n1990s, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) increasingly thought that\nit should oversee the trading of CDSs on the grounds that these derivatives amounted\nto futures contracts. The banks and insurers lobbied strenuously against this to protect\ntheir new, highly lucrative profit stream. In 1996, then-President Bill Clinton appointed\nattorney Brooksley Born as head of the CFTC. Born started pushing hard to get deriva-\ntives under her commission’s oversight, but many pushed harder to ensure that deriva-\ntives were unregulated. Michael Greenberger, the former director of the CFTC, alleged\nthat he once entered Born’s office as she was putting down the phone after speaking to\nformer Assistant Treasury Secretary Larry Summers. She indicated that she had been\ninstructed to stop her efforts to have derivatives regulated (Inside Job, 2010, p. 20).\n\nIn December 2000, the Commodities Futures Modernization Act was passed,\nand it specifically excluded the regulation of derivatives by the CFTC. From here on,\nmortgage loans issued with dubious credit, MBSs, CDOs, and CDSs took off on a steep\ntrajectory. The whole toxic mix was simultaneously fueled by reductions in the cash\nreserves that banks were required to keep, as well as reductions in interest rates by the\nFederal Reserve Bank. In April 2008, The Economist reported:\n\nBankers gathering in Vienna this week for the annual bash of the International\nSwaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) had some big numbers to celebrate.\nThe overall market for over-the-counter derivatives shot up to $455 trillion at the\nend of 2007. Some $62 trillion of that were credit-default swaps (CDSs), whose\nsupercharged growth continues in spite of the crunch. (“Clearing the Fog”)\n\n307\n''"

              "value": "308\n\nChapter 9 © Mortgage Mayhem\n\nOf course, much of this $62 trillion was backed or covered by subprime loans, and\nmost of the issuers of the CDSs had no hope of being able to pay out the amounts that\nthey had guaranteed if mortgage borrowers defaulted and housing prices dropped.\n\nHARD TIMES\n\nAs the mortgage lending industry grew in size and in the direction of engineering and\nsecuritizing subprime mortgages, credit-default swaps grew as a tool intended to insure\ninvestors against loans that went into default. Investment bankers and AIG, as well as the\nmonoline insurers (i.¢., insurance companies that insure against only one type of risk),\nwrote CDSs that “guaranteed” to pay the holders of the swaps in the event of default.\nHowever, soon the investment banks and mortgage lenders themselves began to invest in\nCD$s to hedge against claims against them in the event of default on the bonds they had\nsold or securitized. Also, the investment bankers often held tranches of the pools of bonds\nthat they purchased and securitized; so they invested in CDSs to hedge against losses due\nto defaults on bonds underlying the mortgage-backed securities that they had pooled but\nnot sold.\n\nAccording to the Financial Crisis Inquiry Report (2011), AIG’s model for its CDSs “did\nnot estimate the market value of the underlying securities” (p. 267). AIG’s CDS model\nfocused only on estimating actual payment defaults. The Report also pointed out that in\n2007, Goldman’s demand for AIG to post collateral for the decline in market value on a CDO\nportfolio covered by a CDS surprised senior AIG executives who believed that payments\nwould be required only in the event of actual losses. Soon, rumors began to spread through-\nout the MBS and CDO markets that AIG and many of the monoline insurers did not have\nthe capital to make good on their so-called “guarantees.” This made it even more difficult\nfor mortgage lenders and investment bankers, including Bear Stearns, Merrill Lynch, and\nLehman Brothers, to sell their ownership interests in mortgages and MBSs. Fear that the\nCDS hedges might fail, and knowledge that house prices and the value of their investments\nin MBSs were falling, made it impossible for Bear, Merrill, and Lehman to get the short-\nterm financing on which they had relied. On February 28, 2008, AIG “reported a net loss of\n$5.29 billion, largely due to $11.12 billion in valuation losses related to the super-senior CDO\ncredit default swap exposure and more than $2.6 billion in losses relating to the securities-\nlending business’s mortgage-backed purchases” (Financial Crisis Report, pp. 273-274).\n\nThe Financial Crisis Inquiry Report (2011), explained how Merrill Lynch had been\nkeen on subprime assets until the failure, in late 2006, of two mortgage-loan firms that\nhad received extended credit from Merrill (p. 257). After this, Merrill concentrated on\npooling its mortgage investments into CDOs and reselling them. However, the “super-\nsenior” tranches (tranches with high credit ratings and lower returns) were hard to sell,\nand Merrill had to hold a large portion of them. The situation was about to get worse:\n“By late 2007, the viability of the monoline insurers from which Merrill had purchased\nalmost $100 million in hedges had come into question” (Financial Crisis Report, p. 259).\n\nAccording to the Report, by the end of 2008, Merrill had provided for\n$13 billion of losses in respect of the monolines and close to another $44 billion on other\nmortgage-related business losses (p. 259). On September 15, 2008, disaster at Merrill\nLynch was averted when it was acquired by Bank of America in a U.S. government-\nassisted sale (Financial Crisis Report, p. 353). Earlier that year, on March 24, 2008, Bear\nStearns had been rescued by a government-assisted sale to J.P. Morgan (Financial Crisis\nReport, p. 290). Lehman Brothers was not so fortunate.\n''"

              "value": "Chapter 9 * Mortgage Mayhem\n\nIn her “Testimony Concerning the Lehman Brother’s Examiner’s Report” (2010),\nSEC Chairman Mary Schapiro highlighted how the risk-taking that began in 2006\ncontributed to Lehman’s collapse: “Lehman invested its own capital in assets such as\nsubprime and Alt-A residential mortgages and mortgage-backed securities, commercial\nreal estate, and leveraged lending commitments” (p. 3). Schapiro’s testimony pointed\nout that in June 2008, Lehman posted a $2.8 billion loss, which it attributed “primarily\nto write-downs on residential and commercial mortgage securities and hedges related\nto these securities” (p. 4). Lehman’s efforts throughout the summer of 2008 to raise\ncapital and sell enough of its assets failed to stem a loss of confidence in its viabil-\nity. In an apparent attempt to increase confidence in its liquidity, Lehman increased its\nreliance on what has come to be known as the Repo 105 Transactions.\n\nIn a typical repurchase transaction (repo), a firm “sells” securities for cash\nwith the understanding that the “buyer” will return the securities for a specified\nprice (usually at a 5 percent discount) at a specified future date. The transaction is\nmade on the grounds that control of the asset has not fully passed to the buyer and\nsuch repos are usually accounted for as “financings” rather than “sales.” However,\nSchapiro drew attention to the fact that Lehman “treated repos as sales” for account-\ning purposes (p. 6). Schapiro cited the conclusion of the Bankruptcy Examiner's Report\nthat Lehman’s “motive for the transactions was ultimately to reduce its leverage: to\ntemporally remove tens of billions of dollars in assets from its balance sheet at the end\nof financial reporting periods and use the cash to pay down liabilities as a means to\nreduce its reported leverage” (p. 6).\n\nThe Lehman Bankruptcy Examiner (2010) described Lehman’s accounting for\nRepo 105 transactions as follows:\n\nLehman accounted for Repo 105 transactions as “sales” as opposed to financing\ntransactions based upon the overcollateralization or higher than normal haircut in\na Repo 105 transaction. By recharacterizing the Repo 105 transaction as a “sale,”\nLehman removed the inventory from its balance sheet.\n\nLehman regularly increased its use of Repo 105 transactions in the days prior\nto reporting periods to reduce its publicly reported net leverage and balance sheet.\nLehman’s periodic reports did not disclose the cash borrowing from the Repo 105\ntransaction-i.e., although Lehman had in effect borrowed tens of billions of dol-\nlars in these transactions, Lehman did not disclose the known obligation to repay\nthe debt. Lehman used the cash from the Repo 105 transaction to pay down other\nliabilities, thereby reducing both the total liabilities and the total assets reported\non its balance sheet and lowering its leverage ratios. Thus, Lehman’s Repo 105\npractice consisted of a two-step process: (1) undertaking Repo 105 transactions fol-\nlowed by (2) the use of Repo 105 cash borrowings to pay down liabilities, thereby\nreducing leverage. A few days after the new quarter began, Lehman would bor-\nrow the necessary funds to repay the cash borrowing plus interest, repurchase the\nsecurities, and restore the assets to its balance sheet.\n\nLehman never publicly disclosed its use of Repo 105 transactions, its account-\ning treatment for these transactions, the considerable escalation of its total Repo\n105 usage in late 2007 and into 2008, or the material impact these transactions had\non the firm’s publicly reported net leverage ratio.

In addition, the SEC con-\ncluded that Lehman had not contravened GAAP. However, post Lehman, accounting\nrules have been changed. (Gallu, 2012)\n\nAccording to the Wall Street Journal, “no former Lehman top executives, includ-\ning CEO Richard Fuld, have been charged with any criminal behavior” (Eaglesham &\nRappaport, 2011). In fact, it is highly likely that “Lehman Brother’s Probably Won’t Ever\nBe Charged With Anything” (Coscarelli, 2012).\n\nAccording to Schapiro, Lehman was required to furnish growing amounts of secu-\nrity in order to continue doing business but was unable to keep up with these demands\nbecause a number of lenders refused to provide even regular loans to the beleaguered\ninvestment bank (p. 4). No government-sponsored plan was successfully executed for\nthe sale or rescue of Lehman Brothers, which filed for bankruptcy on September 15,\n2008—the same day that Merrill Lynch was acquired by Bank of America (Financial\nCrisis Report, p. 353).\n\nSchapiro (2010) summarized the factors that contributed to both the financial cri-\nsis and the demise of Lehman as follows:\n\n¢ Irresponsible lending practices, which were facilitated by a securitization process\nthat originally was viewed as a risk reduction mechanism;\n\n¢ Excessive reliance on credit ratings by investors;\n\ne A wide-spread view that markets were almost always self-correcting and an inad-\nequate appreciation of the risks of deregulation that, in some areas, resulted in\nweaker standards and regulatory gaps;\n\n¢ The proliferation of complex financial products, including derivatives, with illi-\nquidity and other risk characteristics that were not fully transparent or understood;\n\n¢ Perverse incentives and asymmetric compensation arrangements that encouraged\nexcessive risk-taking;\n\ne Insufficient risk management and risk oversight by companies involved in mar-\nketing and purchasing complex financial products;\n\n¢ A siloed financial regulatory framework that lacked the ability to monitor and\nreduce risks flowing across regulated entities and markets; and\n\n¢ The lack of an adequate statutory framework for the oversight of large investment\nbank holding companies on a consolidated basis.

As described earlier in this chapter, once Fannie\nMae was given permission to buy conventional mortgages that were not government-\nguaranteed, the door was opened to the formation of new types of mortgage companies\nthat competed with banks and savings and loans.

These subprime loans were often pooled and sold to the\nsecondary market as whole loans or as mortgage-backed securities.\n\nAccording to numerous reports, Angelo Mozilo (cofounder of Countrywide\nwith David Loeb*) established Countrywide with the passion of a true believer in the\nbenefits of homeownership. Adam Michaelson (2009), in his book The Foreclosure of\nAmerica, stated that Mozilo and Loeb “had a dream that they could build a new kind\nof mortgage company and one day be in the position to help all Americans achieve\nthe dream of home ownership” (p. 140). With this goal, the company that later became\nCountrywide Financial Corporation began in Calabasas, California, as Countrywide\nCredit Industries.\n\nMozilo had the vision, the energy, and the charisma to grow Countrywide into\nthe largest mortgage lender in the nation. By 1992, Countrywide was the nation’s big-\ngest original lender of single-family mortgages, and the company continued to grow.\nAccording to the SEC, Countrywide “originated over $490 billion in mortgage loans in\n2005, over $450 billion in 2006, and over $408 billion in 2007” (SEC Complaint, October 24,\n2012, par. 3). Wall Street analysts would wait with bated breath to hear what Mozilo had\nto say about mortgages and the housing market. In fact, by the summer of 2007 (shortly\nbefore the mortgage bubble burst), “Mozilo was the market” (Muolo & Padilla, 2010, p. 2).\n\nThe SEC summed up Countrywide’s early business model as follows: “Historically,\nCountrywide’s primary business had been originating prime conforming loans that\nwere saleable to Government Sponsored Entities (GSEs)” (SEC Complaint, June 4, 2009,\npar. 17). This was a solid business model because in the early days, the GSEs would buy\nonly mortgage loans that conformed to low-risk standards and important attributes\nsuch as loan to home-value ratios, borrowers’ debt-to-income ratios, and their credit\nscores. At the time of Countrywide’s inception, securitization did not yet exist, and\nCountrywide depended on selling its low-risk loans to the GSEs in order to obtain\nfurther capital to make more loans.\n\nMichaelson (2009), a vice president at Countrywide from 2003-2006, wrote of the\nhigh standards instilled in the Countrywide workforce during his early days at the\ncompany:\n\nWith a precision and a professionalism I had not seen since the Air Force, the\nmechanisms of Countrywide processes, procedures, checking and rechecking,\nand attention to perfect, verifiable detail had to be on a par with or exceeding that\nof NASA. (p. 111)\n\nHowever, in the mortgage industry, more and more nonconforming loans were\npurchased, pooled, and segmented into tranches of different grades of risk and then sold to\ninvestors as mortgage-backed securities. Soon, Countrywide had many competitors who\nconcentrated on these precarious, large subprime loans with riskier loan-to-value ratios,\ndebt-to-income ratios, and credit scores, as well as lacking in the documentation of income.\nTo remain competitive, Countrywide jumped on the subprime bandwagon. The nature of\nthe company’s transition from prime conforming loans to prime nonconforming loans and\nsubprime loans can be seen in Table 9.1, extracted from the SEC’s June 4, 2009, Complaint.\n\n \n\n* Loeb died in July 2003, at the age of 79. He was the retired chairman of IndyMac which, “split off from\nCountrywide in 1997” (Vincent, 2003).\n\n311\n''"

U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Par. 18. www.sec.gov.\n\nThe SEC Complaint (June 4, 2009) described up Countrywide’s dramatic transfor-\nmation as follows:\n\nIn 2004, Countrywide’s reported production of conventional conforming loans\ndropped to 38.2%, its production of subprime loans had risen to 11%, its produc-\ntion of home equity loans had risen to 8.5%, and its production of conventional\nnon-conforming loans had risen to 38.7%. By 2006, Countrywide had turned its\nprior business model on its head: a mere 31.9% of its originations were conform-\ning, 45.2% were non-conforming, 8.7% were subprime, and 10.2% were home\nequity. (par. 19)\n\nAs the subprime mortgage lenders lowered underwriting standards, competition\nto remain the biggest lender may have been one of the forces that drove Countrywide\ndeeper and deeper into high-risk subprime loans. The higher interest rates on subprime\nloans may also have been a contributing factor.\n\nA 2007 article in the New York Times reported, “Last year, for example, the profit\nmargins Countrywide generated on subprime loans that it sold to investors were\n1.84 percent, versus 1.07 percent on prime loans.” According to former Countrywide\nemployees, “[T]he company’s commission structure rewarded sales representatives for\nmaking risky, high-cost loans.” (Quotes from Morgenson, 2007)\n\nIncreased Credit Risk\n\nA particularly risky loan was the 80/20 loan, whereby the borrower took out a\nloan for 80 percent of the purchase price of the house as well as a second loan for\n20 percent of the purchase price, with the result that at the time of purchase, the\nborrower had no equity in the house. Internal e-mails sent in March and April 2006\nshow that senior officers at Countrywide were aware of the risks associated with\nthese essentially 100 percent loans, especially when the loans were made under\nexceptions to underwriting compliance guidelines. In fact, in March 2006, Mozilo\nstated in an e-mail that the 80/20 subprime loan was “the most dangerous product in\n''"

These adjustable-rate mort-\ngage loans allowed for a variety of payments options, one of which was “a minimum\npayment which was insufficient to cover accruing interest” (SEC Complaint, June 4,\n2009, par. 58). Typically, once the unpaid interest on the loan reached 15 percent of the\nprincipal amount borrowed, the loan repayment would reset so that future payments\nwould cover both principal and interest. According to the SEC, most of these loans\nwere held for investment as opposed to being sold into the secondary market.\n\nAdam Michaelson (2009) described the meeting at which Countrywide announced\nthe establishment of the pay-option loan, and after the announcement, he asked, “How\ndid you reach the conclusion that home values, and therefore their ability to be refi-\nnanced, might go up forever?” (p. 21).\n\nMichaelson received the following reply: “Well, forecasting has run the numbers\nand ... we believe that housing values will continue to rise for the foreseeable future,\nespecially in major metros such as Los Angeles, New York, and others” (p. 20). The\nspeaker continued: “We feel strongly that we have vetted the scenarios, and the risk is\noffset by the opportunity for market share and revenue gain ...” (p. 21).\n\nMichaelson then followed up with a second question, “Are you ... nuts?” It is clear\nthat although Michaelson thought at the time that the pay-option loan was a foolish\nidea, when he wrote his book, he did not believe that Countrywide and many of the\nother lenders were “sinister in their intent.” He seems have seen Countrywide as hav-\ning been impelled by the “forces of the market place.” (Quotes from Michaelson, 2009,\npp. 21, x, xiv)\n\nAngelo Mozilo was another Countrywide executive who tried to warn the other\nexecutives that these pay-option ARM loans could be toxic. According to the SEC, in\nApril 2006, Mozilo wrote in an e-mail, “Since over 70% [of pay-option ARM customers]\nhave opted to make the lower payment it appears that it is just a matter of time that\nwe will be faced with much higher resets and therefore much higher delinquencies”\n(qtd. in SEC Complaint, June 4, 2009, par. 63). Less than six months later, Mozilo urged\nCountrywide Bank to “sell all newly originated pay options and begin rolling off the\nbank balance sheet, in an orderly manner, pay options currently in that port[folio]”\n(qtd. in SEC Complaint, June 4, 2009, par. 69).\n\nCountrywide was not the first mortgage lender to introduce the risky pay-option\nARM loan. However, these risky loans were issued in addition to the risks on other\nexception loans issued at standards below regular underwriting standards. The com-\npany had a particularly toxic mix of these loans. For example, it had loans based on\nstated income, loans to borrowers with low credit scores or high debt-to-income ratios,\nloans with high LTV ratios, 80/20 or 100 percent loans, and pay-option ARM loans.\nThis combination of loans made Countrywide’s business model unsustainable once\nproperty values stopped rising—and the business model was disastrous when home\nvalues fell dramatically.\n\n313\n''"

              "value": "314\n\nChapter 9 © Mortgage Mayhem\n\nCOUNTRYWIDE’S MISLEADING DESCRIPTION OF\nLOANS IN SEC FILINGS\n\nThe SEC Complaint alleged that the description of Countrywide’s loans in its 10-Ks was\nmisleading “because its description of ‘prime non-conforming’ and ‘nonprime’ loans in\nits periodic filings were insufficient to inform investors what type of loans were included\nin these categories” (June 4, 2009, par. 20). For example, the SEC Complaint alleged:\n\nNothing ... informed investors that Countrywide’s “prime non-conforming”\ncategory included loan products with increasing amounts of credit risk. While\nguidance issued by the banking regulators referenced a credit score (“FICO\nscore”) at 660 or below as being an indicator of a subprime loan, some within the\nbanking industry drew the distinction at a score of 620 or below. Countrywide,\nhowever, did not consider any FICO score to be too low to be categorized within\n“prime.” Nor did Countrywide’s definition of “prime” inform investors that its\n“prime non-conforming” category included so-called “Alt-A” loan products with\nincreasing amounts of credit risk, such as (1) reduced or no documentation loans;\n(2) stated income loans; and (3) loans with loan to value or combined loan to value\nratios of 95% and higher. Finally, it did not disclose that Pay-Option ARM loans,\nincluding reduced documentation Pay-Option ARM loans, were included in the\ncategory of prime loans. Moreover, to the extent these extremely risky loans were\nbelow the loan limits established by the government sponsored entities that pur-\nchased these loans (“GSEs”), they would have been reported by Countrywide\nas prime conforming loans. In 2005 and 2006, Countrywide’s Pay-Option ARMs\nranged between 17% and 21% of its total loan originations. (June 4, 2009, par. 21)\n\nThe SEC Complaint also maintained that Countrywide did not disclose the extent\nof the changes to its underwriting guidelines. The company used an automated under-\nwriting system known as “CLUES” that analyzed “several variables such as FICO scores,\nloan to value ratios, documentation type (e.g., full, reduced, stated) and debt-to-income\nrations” (June 4, 2009, par. 28). However, “The elevated number of exceptions resulted\nlargely from Countrywide’s use of exceptions as part of its matching strategy to intro-\nduce new guidelines and product changes” (June 4, 2009, par. 29). Apparently, as early\nas September 2004, Countrywide’s own Risk Management department warned the\ncompany’s senior officers that “several aggressive features of Countrywide’s guidelines\n(e.g., high loan-to-value programs, ARM loans, interest only loans, reduced documen-\ntation loans, and loans with layered risk factors) significantly increased Countrywide’s\ncredit risk” (SEC Complaint, June 4, 2009, par. 33).\n\nAlthough the SEC Complaint (June 4, 2009) alleged that the increased risk of the\nloans was not fully described in the periodic filings, it should be noted that the fil-\nings did reveal signals that could have alerted readers to the possibility of loan losses\nincreasing greatly in the future.\n\nCOUNTRYWIDE’S UNDERESTIMATION OF ALLOWANCE\nFOR LOAN LOSSES\n\nAlthough the SEC alleges that many of the risk factors were not properly disclosed, in\nCountrywide’s filings, the SEC Complaint (June 4, 2009) did not specifically address\nCountrywide’s calculations of its allowance for loans losses in respect of its loans held\n''"

In addition, the Complaint did not address Countrywide’s calculation of the\namounts of the allowances for loan losses on loans held for sale in the years leading up\nto 2007 or the amounts of Countrywide’s provision for representations and warranties\non loans it had securitized and sold in the years leading up to 2007. The SEC noted\nthat enormous losses were incurred in 2007 in all of these areas. Considering all these\naspects together in Form 10-Q for the third quarter of 2007, the SEC stated the following:\n\nThe company’s Form 10-Q, filed on November 9, 2007, disclosed that Countrywide\nhad taken a $1 billion impairment loss on its loans held for sale and mortgage\nbacked securities, and had taken $1.9 billion in credit charges related to its allow-\nance for loan losses and its provision for representations and warranties on loans\nit had securitized and sold. (SEC Complaint, June 4, 2009, par. 106)\n\nWhile the SEC Complaint (June 4, 2009) alleged that attributes of the loans under-\nwritten were not properly disclosed, it did not make any allegations regarding the fact\nthat the loan losses in 2007 were much greater than the amounts provided for in the\nallowances for loan losses in the financial statements in the years leading up to 2007.\nThe 10-K filing for 2007 showed loans held for investment net of an allowance for loan\nlosses of approximately $2.4 billion at December 31, whereas the allowance for loans\nlosses at December 31, 2006, was only approximately $0.33 billion. The possible reason\nthat the SEC Complaint (June 4, 2009) did not make an allegation about the fact that\nthe allowances for loan losses before 2007 were so much smaller than the allowances\nfor loan losses in 2007 could be that even with the alleged undisclosed risk in the loan\nportfolio description and even with the increased delinquencies, Countrywide may not\nhave known of the size of the losses that would occur. Because Countrywide may have\nbelieved that the homes that secured the loans could be sold to recover loans of bor-\nrowers who defaulted, the size of the impending losses may unwittingly have been\nunderestimated.\n\nUpon default of loans on which the full interest had to be paid monthly, little or\nno loss would be incurred on foreclosure as long as house prices did not fall. For pay-\noption loans, or loans of close to 100 percent on which the borrowers chose to pay less\nthan the interest amount, little or no loss would occur on default and foreclosure as\nlong as house prices continued to rise as fast as the unpaid interest.\n\nFor loan losses to occur at the alarming rate and extent to which they did, borrow-\ners had to become delinquent on loan repayments and house prices had to fall. It could\nbe argued that leading up to the financial meltdown, many people honestly might not\nhave anticipated the possibility of a sharp drop in the price of houses. Like the period\njust before the Great Depression of 1929, “those simpler souls who had thought the\nmarket might go up forever” (Galbraith, 1997, p. 90) were highly unrealistic. However,\nthey may have really believed this myth and may have had no deliberate intention\nto deceive.\n\nSIGNALS OF COUNTRYWIDE’S UNDERESTIMATION OF\nALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES\n\nHere is an examination of some of the signals indicating that a company may have\nunderstated its allowance for loan losses. A combination of all three of the following\nsignals is particularly alarming.\n\n315\n''"

On December 20, 2006, an article in the New York\nTimes cited a report that projected a high foreclosure rate for subprime mortgages. The\nreport examined a number of factors contributing to the increase in subprime mortgage\nforeclosures—for example, “adjustable rate mortgages with steep built-in rate and pay-\nment increases, prepayment penalties, limited income documentation and no escrow\nfor taxes and insurance. The report said that the features caused a higher risk of default\nregardless of the borrower’s credit score” (Nixon, 2006).\n\nAs early as January 2003, an article in the Wall Street Journal warned that in the\nsubprime sector, the numbers of delinquent loans and foreclosures were much higher\nthan expected (Barta, 2003). In December 2005, the Washington Post published an article\ntitled “Mortgage Stress Seen for ‘06; Delinquencies on Subprime Loans Likely to Spike,\nReport Says” (Downey). In September 2006, Business Week dubbed adjustable ARM\nloans “Nightmare Mortgages” and pointed out, “The option adjustable rate mortgage\n(ARM) might be the riskiest and most complicated home loan product ever created”\n(Der Hovanesian).\n\nFor the years ended December 31, 2004, 2005, and 2006, Countrywide’s allow-\nance for loan losses as a percentage of loans held for investment did not increase\nin proportion to the increased risk due to the increase in the pay-option ARM loan\nportfolio segment of the loans held for investment. In Table 9.2, note that the allow-\nance for loan losses surprisingly dropped from 0.314 percent of all loans held for\ninvestment in 2004, to only 0.27 percent in 2005. It then increased to only 0.333 percent\nin 2006. Meanwhile, as shown in Table 9.3, the pay-option ARM loans increased dra-\nmatically: from $4.7 billion in 2004, to $26.12 billion in 2005, to $32.87 billion in 2006.\n''"

The\nrapid increase in delinquencies of pay-option ARM loans from 2004-2006 was a signal\nof the rapid future increases in delinquencies and loan losses that were likely to occur\nas the loans reset over time. Of course, one would not expect the allowance for loan\nlosses on all loans held for investment to increase in the exact same proportion as the\ndelinquencies on the pay-option ARM loan section of all loans. However, delinquent\npay-option ARM loans are troubled loans, and in the absence of the reporting of other\nmeasures of troubled loans in total, one should take it as an alert when the allowance\nfor loan losses as a percentage of all loans held does not increase nearly as signifi-\ncantly as the increase in delinquencies on a significant and high-risk section of the\nloan portfolio such as pay-option ARM loans.\n\nThere were two clear signals in Countrywide’s financial statements that loan losses\nin 2007 could be much greater than the allowance for loan losses at the end of 2006:\n\n1. The allowance for loan losses was not increasing nearly as much as the high-\nrisk pay-option section of the total loans held for investment was growing. (See\nSignal #1.)\n\n2. The allowance for all loan losses was not increasing nearly as much as the delin-\nquencies on pay-option loans were increasing.\n\nIn fact, huge losses became evident in 2007, when the allowance for loan losses on\nall loans held for investment jumped from $0.261’ billion in 2006 to $2.34 billion in 2007.\n\nSIGNAL #3: ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES NOT INCREASING SIGNIFICANTLY AS HOUSE\nPRICES FALL If the allowance for home loan losses does not increase when the value of\nhouses decreases, it is a signal that the company may be understating the allowance for\nloan losses. The value of the house is the security for the loan if the borrower becomes\nunable to pay the loan. If the loans become troubled and the price of houses declines,\nthere is an increased likelihood that the lender will suffer a loss on the loan.\n\nIn August 2006, Barron’s published an article by Lon Witter stating that the\nCommerce Department’s estimates indicated that house prices had started to fall\nand that the price of new homes in the United States had dropped 3 percent since\nthe beginning of the year. The article went on to say, “By any traditional valua-\ntion, housing prices at the end of 2005 were 30% to 50% too high.” It warned that “a\nhousing crisis approaches” (Witter, 2006). Indeed, the prediction in Barron’s proved\nto be correct.\n\nLoans with close to 100 percent loan-to-value ratios and loans on which inter-\nest is not being fully paid depend on rising house prices to avoid loan losses when\nborrowers default. Instructed by the financial meltdown of 2008, we now know that\nif a lender’s allowance for loan losses does not increase significantly when house\nprices stall or begin to fall, it is a strong signal that the allowance for loan losses is\nunderestimated.\n\n \n\n” In the 2007 10-K, the comparative amount for the 2006 allowance for loan losses on loans held for investment\nwas stated as $0.327 billion. In the 2006 10-K, the allowance for loan losses was stated as $0.261 billion. Either\nway, there was a dramatic increase from 2006 to 2007.\n\n323\n''"

Countrywide’s notes\nto its financial statements did disclose a large increase pay-option ARM loans as a per-\ncentage of its portfolio. The notes also disclosed a significant increase in the pay-option\nARM loans with accumulated negative amortization in its loans held for investment.\nHowever, the allowance for loan losses in Countrywide’s financial statements did not\nincrease in proportion to the increase in the percentage of delinquencies reported on\npay-option ARM loans, or in proportion to the increase in the high-risk pay-option\nARM loans or the increase in loans with accumulated negative amortization. The rel-\nevant notes are presented in Exhibit 9.4.\n\nACCOUNTING LESSONS FROM THE MORTGAGE CRISIS\n\nGoing forward, we can take instruction from the mortgage-backed securities crisis that\nwas at the heart of the financial meltdown of 2008. It is a signal that loan loss provisions\nin financial statements are probably understated when they do not rise in proportion to\ndelinquencies on loan repayments or other indications of troubled loans. It is an addi-\ntional signal when house prices begin to decline and provisions for loan losses do not\nrise in proportion to delinquencies or other signs of troubled loans. It is also an indication\nthat loan losses may be understated when the provision for loan losses does not increase\nin proportion to the increase in the high-risk loans portion of a lender’s loan portfolio.\n\nARE THEY LIVING HAPPILY EVER AFTER?\n\n¢ Countrywide, once the largest mortgage company in the United States, was\nacquired by Bank of America in 2008. Countrywide has faced a barrage of law-\nsuits over the years. In April 2013, Countrywide agreed to pay $500 million in\nthree connected class-action lawsuits “to settle claims that it misrepresented the\ninvestment quality of mortgage-backed securities” (Raub, 2013). On October 23,\n2013, “Bank of America Corp.’s Countrywide unit was found liable by a jury for\nselling Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac thousands of defective loans in the first mort-\ngage-fraud case brought by the U.S. government to go to trial” (Hurtado, 2013).\nThe U.S. Attorney’s office is requesting fines of up to $848 million.\n\nAngelo Mozilo, former CEO of Countrywide, settled an SEC civil fraud case for $67.5\nmillion in October 2010. Bank of America paid $45 million of this amount. Mozilo did\nnot admit or deny any wrongdoing in respect of this case (Dobuzinskis & Levine,\n2010). A criminal investigation against Mozilo was never officially announced and\nwas quietly dropped in February 2011. Federal prosecutors reportedly determined\nthat Mozilo’s actions “did not amount to criminal wrongdoing” (Reckard, 2011).\nDavid Sambol (formerly president of Countrywide) and Eric Sieracki (formerly\nCFO of Countrywide) also settled SEC charges in 2010 (Dobuzinskis & Levine,\n2010). They agreed to the payment of fines and “neither admitted nor denied the\ngovernment's charges” (Morgenson, 2010).\n''"

Leading standards have recognized the centrality of ethics and have explicitly integrated\nethics into the elements of effective compliance and enterprise risk management.\n\n3. Organizations are making meaningful changes to embrace this trend and implement\nleading practices to make their regulatory compliance and risk management programs\nmore effective.\n\nEthics and the Federal Securities Laws\n\nThe debate about how law and ethics relate to each other traces all the way back to\nPlato and Aristotle. I am not the Director of the Office of Legal Philosophy, so I won’t\ntry to contribute to the received wisdom of the ages on this enormous topic,’ except\nto say that for my purposes today, the question really boils down to staying true [to]\nboth the spirit and the letter of the law.\n\nFramed this way, ethics is a topic of enormous significance to anyone whose job it\nis to seek to promote compliance with the federal securities laws. At their core, the\nfederal securities laws were intended by Congress to be an exercise in applied ethics.\nAs the Supreme Court stated almost five decades ago,\n\n[a] fundamental purpose, common to [the federal securities] ... statutes, was\nto substitute a philosophy of full disclosure for the philosophy of caveat\nemptor and thus to achieve a high standard of business ethics in the securi-\nties industry.... “It requires but little appreciation ... of what happened in\nthis country during the 1920’s and 1930’s to realize how essential it is that the\nhighest ethical standards prevail” in every facet of the securities industry.’\n\nOf course, what has happened through the financial crisis I believe is yet another\nreminder of the fundamental need for stronger ethics, risk management and reg-\nulatory compliance practices to prevail. Congress has responded once again, as it\ndid after the Great Depression, with landmark legislation to raise the standards of\nbusiness ethics in the banking and securities industries.\n\n* For a deeper plunge into the relationship between law and ethics, a classic exchange on this subject can\nbe found in Positivism and the Separation of Law and Morals, H.L.A.

TierOne eventually filed for bank-\nruptcy shortly after the bank was shut down by OTS in June 2010.\n\nPARAGRAPHS 24-29\n\n24. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, or “GAAP,” provides that a loan\nbecomes “impaired” when it is probable that the bank will be unable to collect all\namounts due under the original loan agreement. In addition, TierOne’s written lending\npolicy stated that a loan greater than 90 days past due should be considered impaired.\n\n25. Under GAAP, TierOne was required to assess probable losses associated with\nits impaired loans and record those losses in its allowance for loan and lease losses\n(“ALLL”). GAAP permits the impairment to be measured using the fair value of the\nunderlying collateral if the loan is collateral dependent, which is the method that was\ntypically utilized by TierOne.\n\n26. Any increase in ALLL (a balance sheet item) must be accompanied by the\nrecording of a provision for loan losses (an income statement item), thereby increasing\nreported loss and further eroding the bank’s capital, which, in turn, negatively impacted\nthe bank’s ability to meet the OTS-required elevated capital ratios.\n\n27. Some of TierOne’s real estate loans were eventually foreclosed upon and\nthe underlying collateral became the property of the bank, or OREO. GAAP required\nTierOne to carry OREO on its books at the lower of the property’s book value or fair\nvalue, less costs to sell the property.\n\n28. Thus, a key consideration under GAAP regarding the existence and magni-\ntude of losses for impaired loans or OREO is the fair value of the collateral or OREO\nproperty. A recent appraisal performed by an independent and certified real estate\nappraiser is normally the best evidence of a property’s fair value. In the absence of a cur-\nrent appraisal, all relevant and current information known at the time must be used. This\ninformation includes: the most recent evidence of market declines, broker price opinions\n(“BPO”), recent comparable sales, internal determinations of value, current project status\nand offers to purchase or sell.\n\n29. In this case, TierOne intentionally delayed the process of obtaining current\nappraisals for properties that had declined in value, relying instead on inaccurate data\nand assumptions.\n\nPARAGRAPHS 60-62\n\n60. In August 2009, OTS directed TierOne to obtain updated appraisals. The new\nappraisals revealed the actual values of TierOne’s collateral for impaired loans and\nOREO. On October 14, 2009, TierOne filed a Form 8-K reporting an additional $13.9 mil-\nlion in loan loss provisions for the second quarter of 2009. TierOne also announced that\nit intended to restate its second quarter 2009 financial statements, and that the bank’s\ncapital ratios would fall below the levels required by OTS. In the days following this\nnews, TierOne’s stock price fell over 17 percent, from approximately $3.27 per share to\n$2.69 per share.\n''"
