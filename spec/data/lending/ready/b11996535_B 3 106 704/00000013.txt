To earn 10 per cent on the annual outlay of $63,070 we require to realize
a price of 13% cents per pound, which should be easy, and enable us to compete
with the better end of Russian flax owing to the better yield of the Feuillette
flax.
One may also consider the production of cheaper fibre from second quality
straw. This would be bought according to value, but still at better prices than
the bargain prices paid now by the buyers of such straw.
Industrial retting, and specially the Feuillette retting, can profitably handle
all grades of straw, while the Lys retting cannot. It is in this manner that
industrial retting would help to extend the growing of flax in diminishing the
uncertainty in its returns and the uncertainty in the sale of its product.
Such is industrial retting as practised in the Goderville rettery. You will
no doubt come to the conclusion that it gives the long-sought solution. And
if the long list of failures would suggest some doubt, you would have to prove
the checked results to be incorrect to deny the progress achieved.
*(Address delivered on 27th June, 1913; translated by Jas. G. Crawford. It must be borne in mind
that the high price of $29 per ton for the flax represents first-class straw saved in good condition, but the
same straw badly saved might not fetch $9 per ton. Land is dearer and taxes higher in France than in
Canada, and all these are elements in the cost. On the other hand, labour is cheap. JAs. G. CRAwford.)
