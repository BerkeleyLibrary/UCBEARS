Paul Getty Museum in Malibu (jpGM) houses a remarkable collection of\n\nGreek and Roman art dating from 3000 B.c. to the fourth century A.D. Com-\n\nplementing these classical treasures is a small yet impressive assemblage of\n\n“Romano-Egyptian” artifacts dating to the time after 31 B.c., when Octavian—\nlater to be known as Emperor Augustus—delivered a crushing blow at the Battle of\nActium to the combined forces of the Ptolomaic ruler of Egypt, Cleopatra VII, and her\nparamour, Marc Antony, and Egypt became a part of the Roman Empire. From that\npoint on the course of world history changed. One can only speculate on how different\nour lives might be today if Egypt and the East had triumphed against Rome. Rather\nthan the millennia-old civilization of Egypt, governed as a theocracy by some consid-\nered to be mere magicians and headed by a ruler recognized as a living deity, it was\nthe culture of Rome that the western world inherited along with its network of roads,\nits public-minded art, and legal system. Had Cleopatra and Antony won at Actium,\nwould we now worship a pantheon of gods, perhaps all syncretized in the being of\nIsis, the goddess whom Cleopatra herself embodied and who was invoked as “a uni-\nversal supreme deity”?' Would the long-lost art and science of mummification still be\nstandard practice in the final farewell to departed loved ones headed for a complex\nafterworld, whose details had been intricately delineated during eons of ponderings\nby Egyptian philosopher-priests?\n\nThe Romano-Egyptian objects in the JpGM collection include a child’s coffin and\nits contents, twelve mummy portraits, a portrait triptych,’ and an intact red-shroud\nportrait mummy (91.AP.6)? The focus of this book is the last mentioned, the mummy\nof a young man named Herakleides who lived in Roman Egypt some two thousand\nyears ago.\n\nOf all the societies of the Mediterranean and the ancient Near East, only the\nEgyptians practiced artificial mummification of the dead. Other burial practices—\ninterment or cremation—would have been anathema to the Egyptians, for the pres-\nervation of the body was an essential element in their construct of the afterlife. They\nbelieved that the body would provide an eternal home for the deceased’s soul of mobil-\nity (the ba), be nourished by its soul that accepted offerings of food and drink (the ka),\nand be a vehicle for transformation into a divine being (the akh). )\n''"

              "value": "Herakleides: A Portrait Mummy from Roman Egypt\n\n10\n\nThe natural desiccation that occurred when the dead were placed directly into\nthe desert sand had been noted by the Egyptians in the predynastic period and served\nto inspire them to attempt to preserve the dead by artificial means. The earliest docu-\nmented, artificially produced mummies date to the beginning of pharaonic history.\nThe mummification process entailed the removal of the internal organs that would\notherwise putrefy and the removal of any other bodily moisture by packing the corpse\nin natron, a natural salt. This simple procedure continued for almost three thousand\nyears with only minor changes. These modifications are the criteria egyptologists use\nto date mummies. For example, until the Middle Kingdom the brain was left inside the\nskull, whereas afterward it was commonly removed. In the Late Period, the internal\norgans were often individually mummified and wrapped in packages that were then\nreinserted into the body cavity. Prior to this, mummified internal organs were stored\nnear the mummy in four stone or pottery vessels called canopic jars. When the Greek\nhistorian Herodotos visited Egypt in the fifth century B.c., he described three meth-\nods of mummification in use at that time. The techniques varied from simple to more\ncomplex, depending upon their cost, but the basic processes were consistent with the\nmeasures in place from the time of the New Kingdom.\n\nWhen the corpse was completely dry, the body was enveloped in a layer of resin\nthat can be seen as a dark, shiny coating on the surface of mummies. The mummified\ncorpse was then wrapped in layers of linen bandages that were solidified with addi-\ntional resin. Included between these layers (or sometimes inside the corpse itself) were\nobjects intended to protect the body. These ranged from amulets of gold and semipre-\ncious stones to figures of wax, resin, and mud. Linen bundles with enigmatic contents\nare more common in the Late and Graeco-Roman periods.\n\nFrom the Old Kingdom on, wrapped mummies received embellishments to\nmake them appear more lifelike, to provide recognizable facial features, and, even-\ntually, to serve as a substitute in case of disintegration of the corpse itself: masks,\nbody covers, and footcases made of durable materials were placed over the bodies.\nThese were made of cartonnage (papier-maché) or clay. Masks for royals were fash-\nioned in precious metals, like the golden mask of Tutankhamun. In the Twenty-fifth\nand Twenty-sixth Dynasties, bead covers with interwoven protective symbols were\nplaced over the bodies as a protective net. In the Ptolemaic period, wrapped bodies\nwere covered with a five-piece suite of cartonnage that protected the head, thorax,\nlower torso, legs, and feet. Wrapped and decorated mummies were placed in coffins,\ninitially rectangular boxes and later in a shape mimicking the anthropoid form of the\nmummies themselves.\n\nIn the Roman period—the time during which Herakleides lived and died—\nthe process of mummification and the burial of the bodies themselves became less\nimportant than the careful decoration of the linen shrouds or cartonnage covers. Bod-\nies have been found that suffered from such careless treatment at the hands of the\nembalmers that bones were broken postmortem and the brain removed, not by the\nmore elegant manner of extraction through the nose, but through large fractures in\n''"

Nevertheless, the wrapped bodies had been deco-\nrated in the most beautiful manner, some with painted faces on wooden panels that\nreplaced the traditional cartonnage or metal masks. Their outer shrouds were covered\nwith the traditional figures of Egyptian mythology, lavished with gold. It seems that\nin the Roman period, appearance was everything.‘\n\nThe religious beliefs that provided the foundation for the practice of mummifi-\ncation were inextricably linked with social practices that maintained the mechanics\nof Egyptian culture. In the late fourth century A.p., the Christian emperor Theodosius\nissued edicts that outlawed pagan rituals, signaling an end to the industry of mum-\nmification. With its demise, the fabric of Egyptian culture was rent, and the balance of\norder (both social and cosmic) that ancient Egyptian civilization had so painstakingly\nmaintained for millennia was destroyed. The significance of the mummy of Hera-\nkleides is that it is one of the last of its kind, a document from the final page of Egypt’s\nthree-thousand-year quest for immortality.\n\nStudying Herakleides’ Mummy\n\nThe collection of Egyptian objects in the y»>GM was acquired despite Mr. Getty’s\npreference not to collect Egyptian artifacts because he found them morbid remind-\ners of death’ How ironic the ancient Egyptians themselves would have found this\nattitude, for their sole purpose in artificially preserving the body and furnishing the\ndeceased with the accoutrements of daily life was to celebrate life in perpetuity. Mr.\nGetty’s initial acquisition of five panel portraits was self-justified because the objects\nwere not referred to as “mummy portraits” but were, rather, designated “Fayum por-\ntraits.” This was a popular alternative designation at the time, for it was then believed\nthat the genre was exclusive to the Fayum district, an area with a large, settled, Greek\ncommunity. However, later excavations have uncovered examples of such paintings\nat cemeteries in areas as diverse as Marina el-Alamein, western Luxor, and Aswan\n(ancient Egypt’s traditional southern border). Although the original cultic function of\nsuch paintings may well have been nonfunerary in nature, the alternative designation\n“mummy portrait” is preferable today. This term is also congruent with the designa-\ntion of complete mummies equipped with impressionistically rendered, painted por-\ntraits as “portrait mummies,” thus named by the father of Egyptian archaeology, Sir\nWilliam Matthew Flinders Petrie (1853-1942).\n\nThe mummy of Herakleides belongs to a subgroup of portrait mummies known\nas “red-shroud portrait mummies.” Following Petrie, Lorelei H. Corcoran defined red-\nshroud portrait mummies as those that belong to one of three categories of body deco-\nrations used in conjunction with mummy portraits (fig. 1).° This technique involved\nthe decoration of a mummy by completely enveloping the body in a single cloth,\nsmooth or stiffened, which was painted red. The red-shroud category is distinguished\nfrom two other methods used to decorate the bodyfields of Romano-Egyptian portrait\nmummies: rhombic bandaging and stuccoed bodyfields with raised motifs.

Were there any precious jewels or amulets within\nthe wrappings? What were the materials used in the mummification and subsequent\nadornment process? Could we date the mummy scientifically?

The study was designed to determine whether or not\nsimilar materials were used in the manufacture of these mummies. The main focus\nwas the red pigment used on all nine mummies. The isotopic investigations carried\nout by the Getty Conservation Institute (GCI) on seven of the nine mummies not only\nidentified the composition and source of the pigment used on each of the mummies\nbut also confirmed that the same pigment was used on all of them, even though those\nmummies from the group that had documented proveniences came from two differ-\nent cemeteries. This discovery provided a compelling link between the fabrication of\nthe mummy of Herakleides and that of other Romano-Egyptian portrait mummies.\n\nA symposium, “Exploring Romano-Egyptian Mummies” (10-11 November\n2006) was organized by the ypcm to bring together scientists and scholars dedicated\nto the study of portrait mummies. Thirteen participants from five countries shared\ndata on the subject. Through the generous and committed cooperation of scientists,\nmedical doctors, and egyptologists, an in-depth study of Herakleides took shape. It\nincluded the identifications and analyses of the materials used for mummification\nand decoration. Imaging technology such as computerized tomography (CT) scan-\nning was used to reveal what was beneath the wrappings. Radiocarbon dating (C-14),\na method of determining the age of organic materials, provided absolute dates for the\nmaterials used in the mummification process. Motifs and religious iconography as\nwell as stylistic changes within the portrait mummy group were documented and ana-\nlyzed. This cooperative exchange of ideas, expertise, and information by experts in the\nsciences and humanities led to an enhanced understanding of the funerary practices\nand religious beliefs of the world in which Herakleides lived and died.\n''"

By the nineteenth century, there were still\n\nonly a few examples in the hands of private collectors such as Henry Salt, British\n\nvice-consul to Egypt, and D. M. Fouquet, a French doctor who resided in Cairo.\nIn the late 1880s, individual panel paintings became the subject of a museum exhibi-\ntion organized by a Viennese art dealer, Theodor Graf (fig. 4). The paintings that were\nacquired for Graf were alleged to have come from the burial grounds of er-Rubayat.\nThey were literally plundered, ripped from the mummies to which they had belonged,\nso that the portraits could easily be transported and displayed in a picture gallery. The\naesthetic appeal of the portraits was confirmed by the successful sale of the objects\npreliminarily offered by Graf, so much so that this success encouraged the further\nransacking of sites to obtain additional paintings. When the portraits were introduced\nto the general public, however, they were viewed with skepticism and perceived as\nfakes. No one had ever seen antiquities such as these before.’\n\nIn 1888 and 1911, Flinders Petrie, under the auspices of the London-based Egypt\nExploration Fund, excavated at Hawara, the Roman-period cemetery for the town of\nArsinoé, where many of the mummies and portraits we are familiar with today were\ndiscovered. Petrie was the first archaeologist systematically to document the mum-\nmies, thereby providing the archaeological community with a better understanding\nof their context and function. His meticulous records and scholarly approach proved\nto all that these portraits were indeed ancient.\n\nPetrie wrote that only about 1 or 2 percent of Romano-Egyptian mummies dis-\ncovered during the excavations in 1888 and 1911 had panel-portrait paintings incor-\nporated into their wrappings.* Moreover, when discovered, many of those portrait\nmummies were in an advanced state of deterioration due to poor mummification\ntechniques or unfavorable burial conditions. In 1995, it was estimated that less than a\nhundred Romano-Egyptian portrait mummies had survived intact.’ However, due to\ntheir portability and appeal as curiosities, over a thousand mummy portraits’ are now\nhoused in museums and private collections around the world.\n\nThe final tribute to the lasting popularity and influence of the mummy por-\ntraits came in modern times.

Mummies covered in multiple layers of linen bandages wrapped in a diamond or\n\nrhombic design\n\n2. Mummies enveloped in a shroud stiffened with stucco and painted red and whose\n\nbodyfield was either\n\nA. divided into horizontal registers filled with figural scenes or religious motifs (see\nfig. 5), or\nB. painted with a fully clothed, full-length depiction of the deceased that continued\n\nfrom the portrait face\n\n3. Mummies whose bodyfield was completely covered with a thick stucco coating where\nfunerary scenes, in horizontal registers or a gridded, apronlike pattern, were modeled in\n\nthe stucco, which was either completely gilded or painted.\n\nWith examples from any of these categories, the bodyfield could be further\nembellished with semiprecious stones, intaglios, or glass inlays. Horseshoe-shaped\nframes, gilt strips of cartonnage, gilt cartonnage buttons, and painted cartonnage\nfootcases were also added to enhance the appearance or value of a decorated mummy\nof this genre.\n\nThe startling appearance of these mummies with portrait faces bound to ban-\ndaged bodies has been described as “a spectacle of ugliness, mediocrity, and incongru-\nity.”\" Nevertheless, in the 1905 volume of the Cairo catalogue Graeco-Egyptian Coffins,\nMasks and Portraits, C. C. Edgar stated, with respect to the portrait mummies that\n“the decoration of the rest of the figure apart from the head . . . descended from dif-\nferent types among the earlier mummies.” Edgar meant that although these deco-\nrated mummies incorporated a new element—a flat portrait painted in a Hellenistic\ntechnique that replaced the traditional three-dimensional painted or gilded carton-\n\n| nage mask—the decoration represented no break in pharaonic tradition. Moreover,\nthe funerary use to which these mummies were put was traditionally Egyptian. The\n“portrait mummies” belonged, therefore, to a continuum of cultic works of art from\nancient Egypt.\n\nThe present study shows that in terms of their decoration the earliest anteced-\nents for the portrait mummies were mummies of the Third Intermediate Period with\nbeaded shrouds. Their last descendents date to the fourth century a.p., after which\ntime pagan burials were officially proscribed. The latter group is represented by Late\nAntique stucco mummies with painted plaster faces such as those excavated at the\nsite of the Coptic monastery above Hatshepsut’s Eighteenth-Dynasty mortuary tem-\nple at Deir el-Bahri. Those mummies, from the end of antiquity, were equipped with\nstuccoed bodyfields embellished with funerary motifs so ambiguous that the excava-\ntor, Herbert Winlock, initially described them as Christian.

They\nbelong to a continuum of indigenous funerary art that evolved flawlessly from the\nearliest beginnings to the very end of paganism in Egypt. The following study will\npresent data to corroborate Edgar’s perfunctory but prescient observation made over\none hundred years ago that associated Romano-Egyptian portrait mummies with a\nnative, pharaonic, funerary tradition.\n\nEgyptian Funerary Traditions\n\nThe lynchpin of continuity in ancient Egypt was religion and a belief in the\nprinciple of maat. The ancient Egyptians personified this principle in the form of a\ngoddess whom they also called Maat. Maat has been translated in modern times as\n“balance,” for it was the goddess, or her symbol—an ostrich feather—that the heart\nof the deceased was weighed against in the final scene of judgment. But maat meant\nmuch more than can be conveyed by a single word and does not always carry the moral\nconnotations of “justice” or “truth.” For the ancient Egyptians, maat was the guiding\nprinciple of life. It provided a check between order and chaos. It carried consequences\nfor both the divine and the mortal realm, for it guaranteed both the perpetual exis-\ntence of the universe and the status quo in society. The maintenance of maat was the\nresponsibility of the gods, the king, and, on a personal level, of every individual. The\nopportunity and privilege to live among the gods after death was ideally available only\nto those who had the ability to pay for proper mummification and to those who could\noffer proof, in the form of an expensive papyrus document now known as a “Book\nof the Dead,” of having lived a life in accordance with maat and of their ability to\nbehave in such a manner as to warrant an eternal life in divine company.\n\nThe ancient Egyptians believed that their souls would inhabit their mortal bod-\nies after death just as the life forces (the ba—the soul of mobility—and the ka—the\nsoul of sustenance)” of the god Osiris, lord of the dead, animated his body after he was\nmurdered by his evil brother, Seth. Although Seth had severed the body of Osiris into\nnumerous pieces that were scattered over the land of Egypt, Osiris’s sister-wife Isis and\nhis sister Nephthys gathered the pieces together, binding them with linen bandages.\nIsis, the great magician and mother goddess, used her powers to revive the corpse of\nOsiris, the first mummy of ancient Egypt. He lived forever after as king of the under-\nworld, a symbol of resurrection, a model and the symbol of hope for all Egyptians. The\nOsiris saga and its solar counterpart, chronicling the diurnal resurrection of the sun\ngod, Re, constituted two enduring themes of the funerary myths and art of ancient\nEgypt. The decoration of the wrapped mummy of Herakleides incorporated icono-\ngraphic elements that reference both of these models for resurrection.\n''"

The mummy was wrapped overall in a\n\nsingle sheet of linen, which was folded under around the portrait panel to expose\n\nthe painted face. In addition to the strips of linen used to keep the portrait in\nplace, traces of resin can be seen where the shroud overlaps the face. Among other\nfunctions, the resin was most likely used as a method of affixing the fabric to the\npainted panel. The entire mummy shroud was then painted red. Over this red paint,\nthe bodyfield was covered with figurative and amuletic motifs arranged in a series of\npseudohorizontal registers (no actual register lines divide the sections). The motifs are\nrelated thematically to images that were woven into bead-net shrouds or painted on\ncartonnage panels of an earlier period.\n\nOne of the interesting features of the decoration of the shroud of Herakleides\nis its limited color palette. The images were outlined in black and painted with white,\nblue, and green. The bodies of the divine figures are covered with gold leaf, in confor-\nmance with the ancient Egyptian belief that the flesh of gods was made of this imper-\nishable, glistening substance.\n\nThe motifs will be described from top to bottom, starting just below the por-\ntrait, although, as discussed below, the reading of the narrative character of these\niconic elements is flexible. As you read this description, you will notice that a vari-\nety of interpretations are offered for a single motif. This is not due to an inability to\nidentify accurately a given motif but rather to a basic tenet of Egyptian religion. The\nancient Egyptians believed that the power of a god or goddess could be enhanced by\ncombining the characteristics of two (or more) deities into one, a process called syn-\ncretization. The jurisdictions as well as the physical attributes associated with these\ndeities would be merged to produce a hybrid form with a multifaceted personality\nand appearance. A more in-depth discussion of the Egyptian approach to the repre-\nsentation of narrative and complex myths is provided below (see pp. 74-76), when the\nmyths and motifs identified on the shroud of Herakleides are compared with those\nthat appear on other red-shroud portrait mummies.\n\nAt each shoulder on the shroud of Herakleides is a wadjet eye, a combination of\na human eye and eyebrow with the markings of a falcon; the hybrid eye is associated\n''"

According to Egyptian myth, the wadjet eye symbolized wellness, for the god\nof chaos, Seth, stole the eye from his nephew Horus, but it was found and restored.\nThe wadjet eye can also symbolize any kind of offering, for it is commonly depicted in\nthe hands of officiants. The eyes of Horus can furthermore symbolize the sun and the\nmoon. In Book of the Dead Spell 151, the right eye is associated with the night barque\n(ship) of the sun and the left with the sun’s day barque, and thus the two together rep-\nresent the entirety of the universe.\n\nBeneath the eyes of Horus appear two antithetical falcons (in profile, facing\ninward). Each stands atop a platform and each wears the bulbous, White Crown of\nUpper Egypt. Between the falcons is a crown of the type usually worn in the Roman\nperiod by the goddess Isis. It consists of a modius (a basket, originally a corn measure)\nthat supports a sun disk flanked by cow horns and topped by a pair of ostrich feathers.\nThe crown borrows elements from the headdress of the Egyptian goddess Hathor, who\nwas considered the daughter, sometimes the consort, of the primary Egyptian solar\ndeity, Re, and who was also depicted in bovine form nursing the Egyptian king. The\ngoddess Isis, the mother of Horus, enhanced her status as the great mother goddess\nby assuming the attributes of Hathor. The crown as an object of devotion (as depicted\nhere) is an example of visual metonymy, where the Isaic crown stands for the god-\ndess herself. By the second century a.D., the cult of Isis had reached its peak and was\nwidespread in the Graeco-Roman world, maintaining its influence into the fourth\ncentury. The temple devoted to the goddess on the island of Philae near Aswan was not\nofficially closed until A.D. 535/37.\"°\n\nIn the second “register” is a larger-scale figure of a winged goddess. The body,\nlegs, and head of the female figure are in profile, facing proper left, but her out-\nstretched, winged arms are en face. In each hand she holds an ostrich feather, the\nsymbol of maat. The goddess is dressed in a body-hugging sheath; only its hemline is\nvisible at her ankles. She wears a wesekh (broad) collar necklace; her hair is in a short\nbob. The goddess stands on a platform consisting of a basket atop a small plinth. At\neither side of her is a tall altar topped by a small offering vessel. The identity of this\ngoddess is intentionally ambiguous, judging from the iconography depicted.\n\nThree Egyptian goddesses are traditionally depicted with winged arms: the sky\ngoddess Nut and the sister goddesses Isis and Nephthys, who took the form of kites\nin order to search Egypt for the severed pieces of Osiris. Nut, like Horus, whose avian\npersonality also embodied celestial connotations, was depicted with wings, for she\nwas considered to have the power to embrace the sun. The image of Nut was sculpted\nor painted on the lids of sarcophagi and coffins dating from the New Kingdom, for\nroyal theology promised that the body of the king would merge with the sun god,\nRe, and be reborn daily in the womb of his mother, Nut. Later, nonroyal individuals\nadopted this motif for the lids and/or troughs of their own coffins.” On her head the\ngoddess wears a crown exactly like the one depicted above (but without the modius).\nThis is the typical crown of Isis in the Graeco-Roman period, adopting the cow-horn\n''"

It provides the name of the deceased:\nHerakleides (fig. 11). The name was popular in Roman Egypt, particu-\nlarly in the Fayum region. It paid homage to the Greek hero Herakles\n(Roman: Hercules), who was revered throughout the Graeco-Roman\nworld for his courage and strength, and who became the patron of\nwrestlers and athletes.\n\nThe second portion of the text is poorly preserved and was\nundecipherable until it was viewed under infrared light (see pp.\n57-58). The letters that were exposed read Thermou (“of Thermos”),\npossibly the name of the deceased’s father. The text on the footcase\nwould then be read as “Herakleides, [son] of Thermos.” The mascu-\nline name Thermos is not acommon one, however, so it was proposed\nthat the second name of the inscription did not refer to the father\nof Herakleides but rather to his mother. Thermou would then have\nbeen an abbreviated form for Thermou(this) or Thermou(tharion),\nwhich the scribe shortened for lack of space. Thermoutharion was a\ncommon name for women in Roman Egypt (e.g. Cairo 33221 fig. 49¢).\nIt is a purely Greek form of the name of the ancient Egyptian god-\ndess Renenutet, a goddess of grain and fertility who, in the Roman\n\nee\n\nperiod, was syncretized with the goddess Isis. The proposed reading\nfor the text then is “Herakleides, the son of [the lady] Thermouthis (or\nThermoutharion),” the deceased’s name and matronym. In addition,\nit was noted that the text was written in a careful, literary hand, one\n\n \n\nthat is more formal in character than a cursive script wherein letters are\nconnected, and that the orthography (shape of the individual letters) was\ntypical of Greek writing in Egypt of the first century A.p.\"\n\nInscriptions on the wrappings or portraits of mummies are known to document\nthe name, age at death, and, rarely, the profession of the deceased (see fig. 49). Others\ninclude a short prayer or sorrowful epitaph (“farewell” or “untimely”). Such informa-\ntion was also customarily supplied on wooden labels called “mummy tickets” that were\ntied to wrapped mummies, especially those that were shipped to another location for\nburial (fig. 12).

Strange\nas it seems to us, it is possible that the upside-down configuration of the amuletic\nimages and/or texts placed in this location were messages intended to be “read” by the\ndeceased. This location was used as a means to “remind” the deceased of important\nfacts relevant to a successful transition to the next world.

Two sites, however, pre-\nsent themselves as possibilities: Hawara and el-Hibeh. Of the twenty-four examples of\nred-shroud mummies included in Corcoran’s corpus,” three were excavated by Petrie\nat Hawara in 1888, two others were from his 1911 excavation, and two were excavated\nat el-Hibeh in 1903 by the British papyrologists Bernard Grenfell and Arthur Hunt.\nIn addition to gilding the background of the portrait and accessorizing it with a gold\ncrown, the artist who decorated the mummy of Herakleides attached gilt square-\nshaped appliqués to the linen that framed the portrait. This motif and its placement\nalong with other similarities of body decoration (discussed below) might argue per-\nsuasively that the mummy of Herakleides comes from el-Hibeh.

The full extent of the panel, where the impres-\n\nsion is visible beneath the bandages, is approximately 45 x 21 cm (18 x 8.5 in.). The\npainting of the portrait is of the highest quality, and the panel portrait is “one of\nthe masterpieces among Fayum portraits” (fig. 13).”\n\nHerakleides is depicted as a mature young man with a full head of dark hair that\nfalls in a thick, wavy fringe over his upper forehead. His eyebrows are full and thick,\nalmost as if penciled in. They thin gradually from their widest point at the bridge of\nhis nose, arch gracefully just beyond the center of each eye, and fade into a perfect\npoint above the outer corners of the eyes. The moustache on his upper lip is thin and\nconsists of stiff, vertical hairs with a V-shaped gap at the philtrum. A dark shadow\nbeneath the lower lip hints at additional facial hair. There are further dark shadow\nlines along the chin and jawline. The man’s flesh is ruddy, especially at the upper\ncheekbone. Dark half circles beneath his eyes and dark shadows encircling his eyes\nfrom the upper lids, sweeping around the inner corner of the bridge of the nose and\nslightly inward back again to the upper cheekbone, give the eye area a puffy, somewhat\nhaggard appearance. The nose is straight, but full, and ends in a not unattractive bul-\nbous tip. The mouth is small, even for such a thin face. The upper lip is thin compared\nto the full, somewhat pouty lower lip, but it bows quite dramatically for its size. The\nhead is turned slightly to the proper left, but the gaze of the deep brown eyes is pierc-\ningly direct, as indicated by small pinpoints of white light reflected in the black irises\nof both. The proper right ear is shown with a tuft of brown hair beneath it; the proper\nleft ear is partially obscured by the turn of the head.\n\nThere are areas of damage, particularly a large vertical fissure running from the\ntop center of the panel and ending at the bottom of the proper right eyebrow. A series\nof shorter vertical breaks are apparent on the lower half of the portrait. These fissures\nare the result of pressure on the thin, flat panel board from having been bound over\nthe convex face of the mummy.\n\nFrom the quality of the mummification and the painted image, in addition to\nthe liberal use of gold, we can infer that Herakleides belonged to the elite of Roman\nEgypt. Intriguingly, therefore, he is depicted with no visible clothing. There is no trace\n''"

Portrait of Herakleides.\nPhotographer: Ellen Rosenbery, Jpcm.\n\nof a formal, white chiton (tunic) with clavi (stripes), which was not only the conven-\ntional costume of adult men in the Greek East (as opposed to the Roman toga) but\nalso one that conveyed elite ideals such as education, wealth, and status.** Adult males\ndepicted in mummy portraits with bare upper torsos have been interpreted as rep-\nresenting themselves as initiates into the cult of Isis,” a ceremony that required the\nprospective member to undergo a submersion in water to emerge reborn and purified,\na rite described by the second-century-Aa.p. Roman novelist Apuleius in The Golden\nAss. Other scholars have suggested that young males such as Herakleides who chose to\nhave themselves depicted with bare upper torsos and a gilded garland may have been\nrepresenting themselves as members of the ephebate, a military training institution\nengaged in gymnastic or athletic contests.”\n\nHis moustache, the symbol of vitality and the idealized male, implies that\nHerakleides has approached maturity. Although individuals in ancient and Roman\nEgypt lived into their fifties, sixties, and beyond, data from the census reports of\nRoman Egypt support the conclusion that the average life expectancy of males was\nbetween twenty and forty years of age.” The visage of Herakleides evokes that of a\nyoung man who died in his prime. The physical evidence from the skeleton of the\nmummy interpreted by a medical team (see pp. 40, 64-65) confirms the impression\nconveyed by the portrait.\n\nThe background of the portrait of Herakleides was gilded after the panel\nwas painted and completed. That is evident at the top of the painting on the viewer’s\nright side where the original upper edge of the panel was covered over by the folded\nlinen shroud that curves around the panel and binds it in place. There, the gilding is\nan irregular line that was applied directly over the painted hair, the extent of which\ncan still be seen going underneath the folded shroud. The gilding also appears to have\nbeen “touched up” after insertion of the panel, as is indicated in areas where the gild-\ning goes over the folded edge of the shroud and onto the painting.\n\nA gilt crown of rhombic-shaped leaves was applied over Herakleides’ hair.\nIn the Mediterranean world, the use of crowns in various contexts was ambiguous\nand ubiquitous.’* Such wreaths were important in Greek and Roman tradition. The\nrhombic-shaped, stylized leaves in Herakleides’ crown resemble laurel leaves. Laurel-\nleaf crowns were awarded to the victors in athletic contests and also played a role\nin funerary contexts. In pharaonic Egypt, wreaths were traditionally associated, in\na funerary context, with the crown of justification that was awarded to the deceased\nafter passing the test of the weighing of the heart in the Hall of Judgment. The wreath\nsymbolized the vindication by Horus of the murder of his father, Osiris. The crown of\njustification could also be depicted as a feathered crown.” In a process of syncretiza-\ntion, the Osiris crown of justification became associated with the solar crown of the\nsun god, Re. The gold used for the crowns mimics the color of the sun. In a passage\nin The Golden Ass, Apuleius describes the initiation of his hero, Lucius, into the cult\nof Isis. The initiate is described as dressed in white linen, his head garlanded with a\nwreath of palm leaves that stood out like the rays of the sun. A papyrus wreath in the\n''"

The mastery of this technique is illustrated by the portrait of\nIsidora (fig. 15). This portrait defines the encaustic technique through its rich impasto\nsurface, creating a translucency and depth difficult to achieve by any other technique.\nIn raking light the encaustic appears sculpted where the artist manipulated the wax\nto create texture and vibrancy (fig. 16). The disadvantage of working in this technique,\nhowever, is that encaustic must be applied in a molten state, which allows little time\n\nto work with and blend the paint before it solidifies. Precision and speed were needed\n\nwith this medium. The painterly realism of so many encaustic portraits raises the\nquestion of how these works were created.

Photo: © The\nState Hermitage Museum.\n\n \n\nThe cestrum, pencillium and cauterium are among the tools that have been\n\ndiscussed by scholars with respect to the encaustic technique.* The cestrum was simi-\nlar to an engraver and was used for incising lines on ivory. Use of the brushlike pencil-\nlium has been identified on several portraits through the presence of brush marks and\nhairs trapped in the encaustic paint layer. It is believed that the cauterium, described\nas a metal spoon or hollowed spatula, was heated over coals and used to blend and\nmanipulate the paints on the surface. An image (fig. 17) on the inside of a first-century-\nA.D. limestone sarcophagus from Kerch, on the northern Black Sea coast, captures an\nartist in his studio warming tools on hot coals, presumably for creating an encaustic\npainting on a panel that rests on the easel.

The addition of other substances, such as oil or egg, can help produce a\ncreamy paint that is easily worked and dries slowly.® Use of this medium might also\nexplain how the wax could have been so skillfully manipulated and blended on so\nmany encaustic portraits.

Although this medium\nhas been described as developing from the decline of artistic aptitude, Herakleides’\nportrait—a skilled example of this technique—disproves this theory. The color palette\nstill appears rich, saturated, and brilliant, and the process no less complex, with shad-\ning and texture achieved through a combination of cross-hatching (fig. 19), outlining,\nand layering systems.\n\nRegrettably, little data on the binders used on mummy portraits have been\npublished. Any number of binders (gelatin, glue, gum, and albumin) may have been\nused with this technique.*° The accurate identification of organic binders can be quite\ncomplex, for they alter and deteriorate over time. Although the term tempera used as\nan artists’ material throughout history is typically associated with egg—and many\nstudies have assumed that egg was used as the binding medium on mummy por-\ntraits—to date, only one published study has reported egg as the binder on a mummy\nportrait.”\n\nA technical study in 2007 of Roman mummy portraits in the collection of\nthe Nationalmuseum in Stockholm produced interesting results for their tempera\nportraits.” The presence of only beeswax was identified on three portraits visually\ndescribed as “tempera.” Ongoing analytical work at the GCI has likewise confirmed\nthe presence of beeswax on the portrait of Herakleides as well as on three other tem-\npera portraits in the collection, but it has not been possible to exclude egg as an addi-\ntional component. The prevalence for identifying different binding media, and lack\nof published data supporting the use of egg as a primary binder, demonstrates the\nneed for more comparative analyses and possibly a reexamination of media terminol-\nogy used to describe mummy portraits. The term wax-tempera has been employed to\ndescribe this technique.* Based on binding-media analyses to date, this might prove to\nbe a more accurate term to refer to the technique used to produce portraits such as that\nof Herakleides that have previously been referred to as “tempera” mummy portraits.\n\nThe Man in the Portrait\n\nThe question of when, during a person’s lifetime, the mummy portrait was\npainted is still unresolved.” Initially, Petrie thought the portraits were painted after\ndeath.* Evidence from panels showing that they had been cut down just before inser-\ntion into the mummy wrappings and his discovery of a framed portrait (BM 1889.1018.1)\nwithin a tomb later convinced him to change his mind and state that the portraits\nwere “originally painted to be hung in the house.’ He suggested that after the person\ndied and was mummified, the portrait was taken down, cut, and inserted into the\nwrappings by the embalmer. The incorporation of the panels into wrapped mummies\nwould, therefore, have been a secondary function.” The addition of gilt crowns, gild-\n\nFigure 19.

The representation in paintings of idio-\nsyncratic features such as this eye ailment suggests that the portraits preserve an\naccurate image of the person within the wrappings. Such rare examples of surviv-\ning portraiture from antiquity would have been made under the influence of Roman\nrealism in art, a concept that was alien to the Egyptians, who followed a tradition of\nstylized imagery.\n\nStylistic Dating of Mummy Portraits\n\nFrom their first discovery the dating of mummy portraits was based on several sty-\nlistic factors: the fashions (costume), beard and hairstyles, and jewelry of the period.\nMost of this evidence came from comparison with classical sculpture and coinage of\nthe same era.\n\nIt was also initially believed that the artistic quality of a portrait and the medium\nused (encaustic or tempera) defined the period in which it was painted.’ For example,\nthe more finely executed portraits in encaustic were considered to have been painted\nearly in the series (dating at the earliest to the reign of Tiberius, A.D. 14-37), whereas\ntempera images were of a later date (third century A.p.). This sequence would reflect\nthe evolution of painting as it developed into the Coptic and Byzantine eras. Never-\ntheless, although changing fashions and styles of the time are important tools for dat-\ning the portraits, fashions can linger or be revived; the artistic merit and quality of a\nportrait may furthermore be related to economics. Petrie established a chronology for\nthe highest- to the lowest-quality portraits, based on his belief that the earlier portraits\nwere better than the later ones. He noted in his 1911 report that at Hawara,\n\nthe group portraits are much better in quality. This is due probably to two causes; the\ngroups are likely to belong to richer families who could afford many portraits and such\nriches were diminishing during the period through the impoverishment of the country,\nand so groups would be mainly earlier; also the richer families could afford better artists\n\nfor their portraits.”\n\nHowever, Petrie also observed a discrepancy in the skills of different artists and\nstated, “No doubt different artists varied greatly, and there might be some poor ones\nearly and superior ones later.”\n\nA great deal has been published on the dating of portraits, and the dialogue on this\ntopic remains ongoing. Historically, dating has of necessity been based solely upon\nthe subjective opinions of knowledgeable scholars. Today, the use of technology such\nas computerized tomography, radiocarbon dating, and scientific analyses can provide\nempirical data against which their positions can be evaluated.\n''"

Malibu, JecM, 74.AP.11.\nPhotographer: Marie Svoboda.\n\n \n\nMost portraits were painted on thin wooden panels, many only 0.9-2 mm in thick-\nness (fig. 23), while some are almost 2 cm thick. Without the accretion of layers of\nbandages that could have provided a flat platform over the face, the thicker, less-flexible\npanels would have been less suitable for placement over the head of a wrapped mummy.\nAlthough some thick panel paintings retain traces of resin and textile, indicating that\nthey were once included within a wrapped mummy, other preserved paintings on thick\npanels were probably devotional images or perhaps even lids of boxes that were used to\nstore sacred objects. Most detached portrait panels with paintings stylistically similar\nto the portrait of Herakleides are approximately 2 mm in thickness; the woods most\ncommonly identified are lime, sycomore fig (Ficus sycomorus),® and oak (Quercus sp.).\n\nGood-quality wood was a precious and rare commodity in ancient Egypt. It is not\nuncommon in the archaeological record to find the use of imported wood (such as\ncedar from Lebanon) as well as the repurposing of timbers. Most of the native wood\nwas of such poor quality that coffins and sculptures made from it were assembled\nfrom many small pieces. The very same arid climate that made for difficult growing\nconditions, however, has been beneficial to wood preservation. Petrie noted that the\ngreatest environmental dangers to the preservation of portrait mummies at Hawara\nwere termites (“white ants”) and moisture. The latter undoubtedly facilitated micro-\nbiological decay.\n\nStudies on the identification of woods used for panel paintings were moti-\nvated by the 1997 exhibition at the British Museum Ancient Faces: Mummy Portraits\nfrom Roman Egypt. Wood identifications now include 114 portraits, 74 from the British\nMuseum alone. The results not only identify the woods used but also suggest practical\nreasons for the selection of certain species of wood.”\n\nThe majority of the panels in the group studied were identified as lime wood (Tilia\nsp.), a species common in the northern climates of Europe and America but not native\nto Egypt today. Although it does not seem likely that this variety of tree could ever\nhave withstood the dry climate of Egypt, it has been proposed that lime wood was\ncultivated in ancient times in the Fayum,® the verdant district that surrounded Lake\n''"

Other common woods used for panels were cedar (Cedrus\nlibani), pine (Pinus), and fir (Abies). It is clear that the woods selected for use as panels\nhad certain working properties that made them desirable, such as surface uniformity,\npermeability, flexibility, and resistance to insects. The choice may have been influ-\nenced also by economics or a workshop’s access to and preference for the wood. The\nsuperior quality of lime wood is the likely reason it was used most often for panels. It\nis easy to work and produces thin, lightweight boards.®\n\nVisual examination under magnification of the ten mummy portraits painted on\nwooden panels in the JPGM collection revealed differences in the preparation of the\npanels depending upon whether the artist intended to apply tempera or encaustic\npaint. With either medium, the panel surface was first sealed to produce a “blank\ncanvas,” in order to improve the overall quality and appearance of the portrait. Paint-\nings executed in tempera consistently exhibit a ground (preparation) layer, ranging\nin color from white to greenish gray. Encaustic paintings, however, do not usually\nexhibit a ground layer but were more often painted directly over a glue preparation\nlayer that acted to seal the pores of the wood and aid in paint attachment. A black\nground layer on the encaustic portrait of a man in a white tunic (JPGM 79.AP.141) is\nbelieved to be a priming layer consisting of plant resin or gum. A similar prepara-\ntion layer has been identified on an encaustic portrait in the Petrie Museum in Lon-\ndon (U.C. 14768).°\n\nOak and sycomore fig panels are typically much thicker and thus cannot conform\neasily to the convex curvature of the head of a mummy. Oak, porous and given to\nsplitting with age, was cut thick to make use of its strength. Oak panels were typi-\ncally covered with a preparatory ground layer before painting, usually in tempera.\nThe selection of oak and its association with tempera suggests, therefore, a practical\nuse for combining these materials. It has been noted that most panels from the cem-\netery of er-Rubayat are painted with tempera on oak, whereas at Hawara the encaustic\ntechnique was used most commonly with lime wood.*° Connections have also been\nindentified between the types of grounds used and specific find sites; lead white was\nfound in portraits excavated at Hawara, and gypsum (calcium sulfate), on those found\nat er-Rubayat.”\n\nThe above-proposed association of wood species and paint media is based on infor-\nmation from only a few portraits. Moreover, exceptions exist. For example, a portrait\nfrom Antinoopolis reported as encaustic was painted on a wooden panel measuring\n1.6 cm thick.®\n\nLinen Supports. Portraits in both encaustic and tempera were also executed on cloth,\neither as separate shrouds or directly onto the mummy wrappings. One remarkable\nexample of a tempera portrait on linen shows a mature woman known as “Aline” (fig.\n24). Her wrapped mummy was found with those of an adult male and three children,\npresumed to be her husband and children. Another mummy, one of the members\nof the red-shroud group of portrait mummies, Leiden AMM 9 (see fig. 46), is not\n''"

The results from these in-depth analytical investigations of Herakleides have\nprovided the point of reference to establish links with other mummies from the Getty\nRed-Shroud Study Group (see chart 1).\n\nAir Analyses\n\nAfter twelve years in a sealed Plexiglas container, Herakleides’ mummy was\nmoved to a conservation laboratory in 2003 for treatment in preparation for its first\npublic exhibition. The first step in that three-year process was to sample the air from\nthe sealed environment of the container even before removing the mummy from it\n(fig. 27).*° The goal was to identify the organic compounds that were off-gassing from\nthe mummy. The air samples were carefully collected and analyzed using GCMS, a\ntechnique used to identify chemical compounds. Numerous natural and synthetic\ncompounds were identified, the latter clearly by-products from the materials used in\nthe construction of the container. The natural compounds presumably came from\nthe decomposition of organic materials within the box, i.e., the\nmummy itself. One compound identified was guaiacol, a bio-\nmarker of cedar oil, documented in the mummification process as\ncedrium, by both Herodotos and Pliny the Elder. Dioscorides (ca.\nA.D. 40-90), an ancient physician and herbalist, wrote about the\nmedicinal value of cedria, listing its uses as a preservative of the\ndead and an insecticide.\"' Recent studies on embalming materials\n(balsams) used in the pharaonic and Roman periods have likewise\nidentified guaiacol, noting the numerous practical uses of cedar\noil for the mummification ritual. It was applied as an aromatic\nunguent, a deodorizer, and an antimicrobial to aid in preserva-\ntion.” A late second-century-a.p. papyrus lists the materials used\nfor a funeral and their costs. Cedar oil, wax, linen, and a red-dyed\n\ncover are among the materials mentioned.\"\n\nMaterials Analyses\nRed Pigment. ‘The pigment and binding media of the shroud of\nHerakleides were the first materials to be identified and inves-\ntigated.

The analyses revealed that the red-lead pigment was complex, composed of\n\nnumerous elements that are found only in processed raw materials.\n\nAlthough red lead is found in nature as the mineral minium, it is more com-\nmonly known as one of the earliest artificially manufactured pigments. Known\nfrom Mesopotamia to China, going back to the fifth century B.c.,* red lead was first\nintroduced into Egypt by the Romans* in the first century A.D. Its use has not been\nreported in pharaonic Egypt. The production of red lead involves the roasting of\nlitharge (PbO). Some of the better-known sources for this raw material are Roman\nsites in Spain.” Isotopic studies at the GCI of red-pigment samples from Herakleides\nand six other red-shroud portrait mummies have revealed that all the pigments are\nidentical (see appendix). Those investigations have also identified the source of the\npigment as the Roman silver-mining site of Rio Tinto, in southwest Spain, a fact that\nexpands our understanding of the extent of the trade network in materials within the\nRoman Empire. With iron oxide readily available in Egypt, the effort to acquire a red\npigment from a source so far away may well have been motivated by a special second-\nary function of red lead: its medicinal and preservative properties.\n\nPliny wrote extensively about red lead, noting that it was one of the most valued\npigments to the Romans.** Rare or expensive pigments would be mixed with cheaper\nones in order to extend them.* It was customary to reserve red-lead paint for the faces\nof statues of important deities, and it was mixed with balsam to anoint the bodies of\ntriumphant generals. However, both Pliny and other ancient Roman scholars clearly\nconfused red lead with other pigments commonly used in this period, such as cinna-\nbaris, that is, cinnabar (red mercuric sulfide), dragon’s blood (the red resin obtained\nfrom several different species of plants), and realgar (arsenic sulfide).\n''"

              "value": "Physical Properties Analyses\n\n51\n\nAlthough red lead was venerated and its use was widespread, ancient scholars\nwere well aware of the toxic nature of pigments. Pliny wrote, “Minium refiners in\na factory envelop their faces with loose bladders which enable them to see without\ninhaling the fatal dust,””° and, moreover, “as cinnabar and red lead are admitted to be\npoisons, all the current instructions on the subject of its employment for medicinal\npurposes are in my opinion decidedly risky.” Although the toxic nature of lead was\nclearly understood in antiquity, it was still prescribed as a medicine because of its\nalleged healing properties, and its use may have reflected this belief. Alternatively, as\na poison, lead makes the perfect insecticide. The choice of red lead may have encom-\npassed all these rationales: the religious/ritual significance of the red color, its healing\nproperties as a medicine, and its toxic nature as a preservative.\n\nAnalyses have confirmed that the red lead pigment\nused to paint the shroud of Herakleides was bound with\nbeeswax, producing an encaustic medium.” Evidence\nof brushstokes, embedded hairs, and drip marks indi-\ncate that the wax was applied molten, mostly by brush.\nThe choice of beeswax as a vehicle for the pigment also\nsupports a logical thought process. In addition to its\nmagical” and economic significance, beeswax also acts\nas a hydrophobic sealant. Scientific studies confirm that\nthe antibacterial properties of wax aid in the preserva-\ntion of organic remains.”\n\nOther Pigments. Other colorants used for decorating\nHerakleides’ shroud are white, blue, green, black, and\ngold. The white pigment, used for painting the wings of\nthe figures of Horus (fig. 29) and Isis and for the crown\nof Osiris, for example, was identified by both Raman\nspectroscopy and XRD as lead chloride (PbCl,).% The\nmore commonly used lead white (basic lead carbonate,\nPbCO,) was not identified in the painted areas. Investi-\ngations of the white pigment suggest that the lead chlo-\nride may occur as an alteration product of another lead\ncompound (lead white) through its interaction with\nchloride salts present in the burial environment and/\n\n \n\nor the embalming materials (natron).

As determined by XRF, areas of both blue\nand green confirm the presence of arsenic (As) with iron (Fe) and calcium (Ca) in\ntrace quantities only identified in the blue areas. Analysis of a blue pigment sample by\nRaman spectroscopy presented a combination of the organic dye indigo along with\nthe yellow mineral orpiment (As.S,). The green pigment visible only on Herakleides’\nfeet revealed the same pigment combination but in different proportions, producing\ngreen. The presence of calcium suggests that a pigment was made of organic indigo\ndye by precipitating it onto a calcium-based substrate.'°° A similar finding was made\non a mummy portrait in the Getty collection (79.4P.142) in an area painted green.”\n\nIt was not uncommon in antiquity for two pigments to be mixed together to pro-\nduce a secondary color. The combination of Egyptian blue and orpiment has been well\ndocumented, from the Twenty-first Dynasty to the Ptolemaic period.’ Until now,\nhowever, the earliest documented use of the mixture of indigo and orpiment, known\nas vergaut, is on the Book of Kells, a ninth-century-a.p. illuminated manuscript.’\nThe discovery of the combination of indigo and orpiment on the Romano-Egyptian\nshroud of Herakleides and on the mummy portrait of a man (JPGM 79.AP.142) is evi-\ndence for the use of this combination of pigments in Egypt at a time approximately\nseven hundred years earlier than had previously been documented.\n\nBlack pigment was used to delineate the figures (fig. 30), add details to the deco-\nration, and create the inscription on the feet. Analysis of the black did not provide an\nelemental identification. However, under a polarized-light microscope, the pigment\nparticles were visually identified as carbon black.\n\nGold Leaf. Thin sheets of gold leaf were used to embellish the shroud and the portrait\nof Herakleides. Gold, a noble metal resistant to corrosion and oxidation, is malleable,\nso it can be beaten into extremely thin sheets, sometimes less than one micron in\nthickness. Gold leaf was used as a way to add color and shine to the overall design.\nSmall precut pieces of gold leaf were adhered to Herakleides’ shroud to define Nut’s\nbody, Osiris’s head, the bodies and crowns of the Horus falcon, and the ibis. Small\nsquare-shaped gold elements also frame the portrait, a detail visible on all but one of\nthe mummies in the Getty Red-Shroud Study Group. Gold leaf was used also on the\nbackground and for the wreath on Herakleides’ portrait. Analyzed by XRF, the gold\nwas found to contain trace amounts of silver.’ This is not surprising, for gold and\nsilver are typically discovered together in nature.’\n''"

The fact that the mummy of Herakleides is heavier than one\nmight expect is evident when trying to lift it: it takes four people to move it safely. This\nis because the mummy is completely encapsulated in a layer of hard, glassy balsam,\na resinous and aromatic exudation from plants that was used in the mummification\nprocess and generously poured over the corpse.\n\nThe first scientific study of mummification materials used as preservatives, pub-\nlished in 1911, remains a methodological model for the comprehensive investigation\nof embalming resins.’°° Mummy balsams have been the focus of numerous scientific\nresearch projects in an effort to determine the precise composition and function of\nthis cultic material.” The findings from these comprehensive studies corroborate the\nancient texts that list the materials used in the mummification process and provide a\nbetter understanding of them and their function.\n\nConifer resin has been identified as early as the Twenty-first Dynasty. Its use\ncontinued into the Roman period when it increased significantly, perhaps to compen-\nsate for the fact that during the Roman period mummies were not as efficiently pre-\npared as they were in the pharaonic era. Decomposition due to poor mummification\npractices such as incomplete desiccation or evisceration was avoided by encasing the\norganic remains in balsam and thereby reducing their exposure to oxygen. Addition-\nally, coniferous resins have antimicrobial properties that aid in preventing biological\ndecay. Cedar oil has been identified on mummies from as early as the Tenth Dynasty\nand into the Roman period, revealing a sophisticated understanding by the embalm-\ners of materials and their properties. Analysis of the resin used for Herakleides con-\nfirms the use of conifer resin, beeswax, and cedar oil (guaiacol).'°* In addition to being\nan adhesive, this balsam mixture serves numerous other functions: as a ritual anoint-\nment, unguent, perfume, and preservative.\n\nTextile. The mummy of Herakleides was wrapped in numerous layers of textile, textile\nstrips, and, finally, a single shroud. The strips hold the wrappings together and also\nfunction to secure the portrait in place. Natural resins were applied between layers of\ntextile throughout the mummy, presumably to glue them together (fig. 31). The com-\nplex system of wrapping is clearly visible in raking light (figs. 32, 33).\n\nDetached fragments from the bottom of the damaged footcase provided samples\nfor fiber and weave analyses. At least three different types of textile weave are visible\non the reverse of one of the detached fragments (fig. 34). Some pieces, all appear-\ning undyed, exhibit a plain weave; others, a more elaborate basket weave. It was fur-\nther observed that the weaves vary in coarseness, with the heaviest weave toward the\nouter surface (a sequence also observed on Spurlock Museum inv. 198.06.001A).'°° This\nintentional feature could have aided the penetration and attachment of the paint layer.\n\nUnder low-power magnification, the fibers appeared very brittle and damaged;\nhowever, the typical S-twist orientation, characteristic of linen, was visible on all three\nweaves.”° Cotton fibers exhibit a natural Z-twist orientation, making cotton easily\ndistinguishable from linen.

Surprisingly, since\nlinen is the fiber most commonly associated with ancient Egyptian garments (and\nmummy wrappings), the plant from which it is spun was not native to Egypt. The\nfibers that produce linen are made from a plant of the flax family that was imported\ninto Egypt from the Levant in the Neolithic period.”\n\nThe creation of a thread from flax fibers is a laborious process involving numer-\nous steps before the final weaving can occur. The Egyptians were skilled in weav-\ning and produced sophisticated cloths for different functions.

For those unable to afford new cloth, the incorporation\nof old clothing and textile scraps in mummy wrappings was common, reinforcing the\nimportance of textiles for Egyptians in both the present life and the next.\"\n''"

The subject encompasses x-radiography, computed axial tomog-\nraphy or computed tomography (CAT, CT), as well as magnetic resonance imaging\n(MRI) and micro-CT.\"5\n\nRadiographs (commonly known as x-rays) were first produced on glass plates.\nToday, we use film or digital imagery. The images that are produced, which are nega-\ntives, capture differences in density and provide a nondestructive method for looking\ninside the mummy wrappings. The ability to view and examine the contents of mum-\nmies became an important advance in their study because it eliminated the need for\ndestructive autopsies.\n\nAdvances through radiography have confirmed the presence of objects such\nas jewelry or amulets within a body or its wrappings. The images have also revealed\nwhether or not the contents of a wrapped bundle are indeed what they were presumed\nto be. X-radiography has revealed numerous “bogus bodies” without the need for\nunwrapping the mummy bandages as in the case of two presumed child mummies,\ncomplete with plaster face masks.

In each of these cases it is presumed that\nsubstitutes were deliberately made for the intended contents but for different reasons:\nperhaps the children’s mummies were lost or badly disintegrated; in the case of the\n“falcon” mummy, less rare and less difficult-to-procure reptiles were substituted for\nthe bird of prey (see a discussion of the substitution of contents in the discussion of\nibis mummies, p. 70).\n\nContinuing with his systematic scholarly approach to archaeological material,\nPetrie was the first egyptologist to explore radiography.

              "value": "Herakleides: A Portrait Mummy from Roman Egypt\n\n64\n\nWith increasing advances and accessibility to imaging technology, it was decided\nthat Herakleides should be examined through CT scanning. In 2005, the mummy was\ntaken to the Department of Radiology, David Geffen School of Medicine, at the Uni-\nversity of California, Los Angeles (ucLA), for full body scans.\n\nThe mummy was carefully packed in its original storage container, transported\nto the hospital, and prepared for CT scanning using a Siemens Somatom Sensation\n16 Scanner. Because of the mummy’s height, it was scanned in two sections at 5-mm\nintervals (fig. 38). One section comprised the head and shoulders, the other the shoul-\nders to the feet. New information became apparent immediately: contrary to what was\nthought from earlier radiographs, the skeleton appeared to be in very good condition.\nThe head faces forward with a slightly open mouth (fig. 39). The arms lie along the\nbody, the hands uncrossed over the pelvis (fig. 40).\n\nOne of the first objects identified within the wrappings was a wooden support\nunderneath the mummy, probably the embalming board. Initially thought to be an\nunusual feature, wooden supports have been identified under other Roman mum-\nmies, indicating that their use was a common practice (see chart 1). The wooden board\nwould have functioned to transport the fragile body safely during and/or after the\nmummification process. In this case, the board—a single plank of narrow wood with\ntapered edges—appears to have been sawn rather than split. This would not be dimen-\nsionally stable, but it would provide the widest board from a small tree. The presence\nof numerous knots in the wood indicates that it came from a small, young tree.'*4 In\ntransverse cross-section, tree rings are clearly visible, and grain patterns can be seen\nin coronal views. The scans in this instance, however, were not of sufficiently high\nresolution to identify the species of wood, but the features can be used to differentiate\nbetween soft and hard woods.\n\nInternal Organs\n\nThe CT scans of Herakleides’ mummy provided good-quality images and,\nunlike the xeroradiographs, allowed the mummy to be viewed from different angles,\nlayer by layer, and even in three dimensions. A team of medical doctors examined\nthe scans and contributed their expertise. They noted that features typically found on\nother mummified bodies were observed on Herakleides’ scans. A cross-sectional view\nof the skull reveals that the ethmoid bone in the nasal passage is perforated, and the\nbrain is missing. This documents the removal of the brain through the nose, known as\nexcerebration, a common practice on mummies in Egypt since the Twelfth Dynasty.’*\nAlmost all of Herakleides’ internal organs had been removed, including his heart, but\nnot his lungs.\n\nContrary to popular belief, Herodotos did not write that the heart was not to\nbe removed during the mummification process.”° The desire to keep one’s heart has,\nrather, been inferred from the numerous spells in the Book of the Dead” that protect\nthe deceased against the removal of the heart in the afterworld. The preservation of\nthe heart was of particular concern to the ancient Egyptians, for their religion held\n''"

Thus, Book of the Dead Spells 30A and 30B enjoin the heart\nnot to testify against the deceased at the final tribunal. Modern scientists have found,\nhowever, that ancient Egyptian embalmers were not always careful to keep the heart\nwithin the corpse. CT scans of the red-shroud mummy of Demetrios in the Brook-\nlyn Museum (inv. 11.600) likewise reveal a missing heart.’** The removal of the heart\nhas also been reported on mummies from other periods of Egyptian history.’ Thus,\nHerakleides’ missing heart is not unique.\n\nFrom the Fourth Dynasty and on into the Late Period, other internal organs\nwere typically removed during embalming in order to be placed separately under the\nprotection of the Four Sons of Horus: Duamutef, the stomach; Khebsenuef, the intes-\ntines; Imsety, the liver; and Hapy, the lungs.° Yet, the lungs of Herakleides remain\ncollapsed inside the chest. Remains of the lungs were likewise reported inside the red-\nshroud portrait mummy in the Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge (E 63.1903).'* Was\nthis evidence of careless mummification signifying the end of a three-thousand-year-\nold ritual or an intentional action by the embalmer? We may never know. Neverthe-\nless, the lack of adherence to tradition, together with the cavalier treatment of the\ncorpse, indicates that in the Roman period, the body itself was valued less than its\nelaborate decoration.\n\nAnalysis of Bones and Teeth\nAge at Death. Important evidence obtained by the CT scans provided the approxi-\nmate age at which Herakleides died. As the human skeleton grows and reaches matu-\nration, cartilage on the ends of bones ossifies or fuses together. The presence of these\nfusion lines, known as epiphyses, are helpful in determining a broad range for the\ndeceased’s age at death. The disappearance of these lines upon maturity, however,\nmakes an exact determination beyond the age of twenty-five difficult. The fusion lines\nseen in Herakleides’ leg indicate that he died around the age of twenty, plus or minus\na few years.’” His age at the time of death corresponds therefore to the youthful man\ndepicted in the portrait.\n\nThis age was further supported by a dental examination. The fully developed\nroots on his wisdom teeth likewise conform to an estimated age of eighteen to twenty\nyears.” His teeth show no evidence of tooth decay or attrition.\n\nHeight. Studies of the average height of ancient Egyptians based on their skeletons\nusing long-bone measurements show that individuals ranged from 160 to 169 cm in\nheight (5’2”-5’6”), with a standard error of estimate of 1.9-4.2 cm.\" It is apparent\nfrom the size of this mummy that Herakleides was probably taller than the average\nEgyptian of the Roman period. The CT scans reveal that his skeleton spans almost\nthe entire length within the wrappings, which measure 179.8 cm. Herakleides’ actual\nheight at the time of death, based on the length of his femur (thighbone), which mea-\nsures 46.56 cm, indicates that he was about 169 cm tall (5’6”).\n''"

Image provided by Alex\nJuncosa, UCLA.\n\nInclusions\nThe Enigmatic Packet. CT scans of the proper right side\nof Herakleides’ chest area, between the layers of textile,\nrevealed a series of small, light-colored spots clustered\ntogether inside the wrappings (fig. 41). These spots, rang-\ning in intensity from faint to bright, indicate the presence\nof objects of different densities. In oblique view the spots\nare aligned in a row; in coronal view they appear to be\nincluded inside a discrete package.

It is common to find amulets inside pharaonic-\nperiod mummy wrappings, usually over the proper left side of the abdomen, to cover\nthe embalmer’s incision made for organ removal. It is believed that amulets were also\nplaced over ailing or vulnerable areas of the body. Although there is evidence of their\ninclusion within mummies of the first to the third century a.p.,\"” the presence of such\nitems within mummy wrappings is not common in the Roman period. In the future,\nbetter imaging methods may help identify the shapes within mummies of the Roman\nperiod and, as a result, lead to a better understanding of the function of these items.\nIn his early reports of the excavations at Hawara, Petrie wrote that mummies\ndid not have amulets or jewelry of any kind included within their wrappings.’* It\nnow appears that the objects he was accustomed to finding within mummies—amu-\nlets, heart scarabs, and jewelry—were not commonly included with mummies of the\nRoman era, whereas other objects, with which he was unfamiliar, are now receiving\nattention,” for example, a leather object under the tongue or wooden boards like that\nplaced under the body of Herakleides. Could the enigmatic packets within the bodies of\nHerakleides and Demetrios have been materials left over from the embalming process\nor objects intentionally placed in or on the bodies for an as yet unknown reason? Future\nstudies using imaging technologies may reveal other interesting inclusions within the\nwrappings of Romano-Egyptian mummies and help to determine their function.\n\nThe Ibis Mummy\n\nNo inclusions one might typically expect, such as viscera packets (bundles con-\ntaining mummified and wrapped organs), were identified inside Herakleides. But\nthere was one completely unexpected discovery: the mummified remains of an ibis\nhad been placed above Herakleides’ hands (fig. 42). The bird’s long, curved beak made\nidentification clear. Additionally, axial slices clearly revealed wing bones and circular\nfeather-shaft bundles. The CT scan in cross-section of amummified ibis from the Yale\nPeabody collection reveals similar diagnostic features (fig. 43).\n''"

Often, therefore, the fig-\nure of Thoth appears more than once in funerary scenes. He can appear in his mixed\nform with an ibis head and mortal body as a scribe, recording the result of the judg-\nment, and he can appear in baboon form atop the scale in which the heart and feather\nare weighed. As this moment of judgment determines the eternal fate of the deceased,\nit is crucial that the deceased pass the test. Book of the Dead Spell 18 empowers the\ndeceased to receive from Thoth a vindication against enemies, and Spell 14 removes\nanger from the heart of a god. Could it be that in addition to such spells, Herakleides\nwished to ensure a positive outcome by bringing an offering to the god who would\ntranscribe the results of the process? Some scholars might consider the suggestion of\nbribing an officer of the tribunal overly cynical. Surely, they argue, there is sufficient\nevidence from the literally millions of mummified creatures excavated at animal cem-\neteries throughout Egypt to indicate a sincere degree of piety on the part of devotees.\n\nNevertheless, the animal-mummy trade was fraught with malfeasance, as is\ndocumented by the practice of selling false mummies at the animal cemetery at Aby-\ndos.'*° Business was so lucrative that in the second century B.c. the priests of Sakkara,\naffiliated with one of the largest ibis cemeteries in Egypt, were brought up on charges\nof abuses and imprisoned. Reforms governing the burial of sacred birds were enacted,\npresumably to prohibit the substitution of bones, feathers, or eggs for whole birds. The\nrequirement was, “one god in one pot,” meaning that every tiny clay coffin ought to\ncontain a whole bird in order adequately to represent the god.\"#”\n\nThe discovery of a mummified ibis within Herakleides’ wrappings is the first-\never find of a mummified animal within the wrappings of a human mummy.\" Previ-\nously documented burials of animals with humans were animals presumed to have\nbeen household pets, such as the burial of a “commoner at Abydos named Hapi-men\n[who] was laid to rest with his small dog curled at his feet.”\"4° The most well-known\nparallel to a joint burial like that of Herakleides and the ibis is the inclusion of a\nwrapped bundle that was placed above the mummified body of Maatkare (Cairo CG\n61028), a woman who held the politically powerful title of God’s Wife of Amun in the\nTwenty-first Dynasty. Maatkare died young, while giving birth or shortly thereafter.\nA small, wrapped package was placed inside her sarcophagus, positioned above her\nmummy, across the thighs. Salacious speculation at the time of the discovery inspired\nthe theory that the young woman, who as a “wife” of the god Amun was assumed to\nhave been required to be celibate (a theory no longer accepted by scholars), had found\nherself pregnant, and that she and her illicit baby were murdered and buried together\nto hide her shame. Others suggested that the two provided evidence for temple prosti-\ntution.

It might have been a votive offer-\ning similar to those made by living persons so that the prayers of the person making\nthe offering would be satisfied in the afterlife.’* In this instance, Herakleides might\nsimply have been a devotee of Thoth.\n\nAnother possibility is that the animal referred to Herakleides’ profession. It\nis extremely rare, however, for evidence of the deceased’s profession to be overtly\nprovided in an inscription on or near the mummy. In fact, there is only one text—\ninscribed on the portrait of a female, rhombic-wrapped, portrait mummy (Girton Col-\nlege, Cambridge, no number)—that has been considered to provide the identification\nof a profession. The text was originally translated by Petrie as “Hermione, teacher of the\nclassics.”*? Others have seen in the epithet only a reference to the young womans lit-\neracy, while another interpretation suggests that she was a female “promoter of Greek\ncultural traditions on behalf of local elites.” In some cases, indications of profession\nare more obliquely provided by visual clues within the portraits themselves. Soldiers,\nfor example, are depicted wearing the sagum (military cloak) and balteus (sword belt).\n\nSince the god Thoth is associated with wisdom, writing, and scholarship, per-\nhaps the inclusion of an animal form of the god indicates that Herakleides was a\nscribe, one of the perhaps 10 percent of the population of Egypt who was literate. Or,\ndrawing a parallel with statues that depict individuals who served as priests of Thoth,\nwho are shown with baboons on their shoulders, Herakleides might have been a priest\nof Thoth, a hereditary profession. Some specialized priests of Thoth were responsible\nfor the breeding, care, and mummification of ibises.'*°\n\nThe discovery of amummified ibis within Herakleides’ wrappings prompted the\nfurther exploration of mummies in the Getty Red-Shroud Study Group. Subsequently,\na CT scan has revealed two bundles of avian remains inside the wrapping of the red-\nshroud portrait mummy in the Antikenmuseum und Sammlung Ludwig, Basel (BSAe\n1030),'” stylistically the closest parallel to Herakleides. These two mummies share an\nidentical iconographic feature: an image of an ibis painted on the outer surface of their\nred-shroud wrappings, although the position of the mummy bundles within the two\nexamples varies with respect to their relation to the ibis image. The substitution of a\nfalcon and an ibis in the case of the two child mummies and the inclusion of a baboon\nor ibises (all animals associated with the psychopomps Horus and Thoth) with human\nmummies present a pattern. Only further research will help us to confirm why these\nanimals were included or substituted in these burials and whether or not the motiva-\ntion in each case was unique or fulfilled some common religious function.\n''"

The\nresin produced a similar age of 1930 +/- 38 years BP. The linen, after several\nruns, provided a date of 1953 +/- 36 years BP.

These dates are somewhat earlier\nthan the mid-second century dates some have proposed for Herakleides and similarly\ndecorated red-shroud portrait mummies, based on stylistic criteria. The difference in\ndates may have its explanation in the practice of the reuse or recycling of materials.\nTextiles could have been retained for as long as fifty years before being reused in the\nfunerary trade, resulting in a date for the textiles that is much earlier than the date of\n\nthe manufacture of the mummy.\n\nRADIOCARBON DATING\n\nRadiocarbon dating was developed\n\nin 1949 by Willard Libby and his col-\nleagues at the University of Chicago.\nIn 1960, Libby was awarded the Nobel\nPrize in chemistry for his further work\non this method, which is used to date\norganic materials up to about sixty\nthousand years old through the mea-\nsurement of radioactive carbon atoms\n(C-14). One of the primary uses for this\ntechnique is to date organic remains\nfrom archaeological sites. Created by\ncosmic rays, C-14 atoms combine with\n\noxygen to form carbon dioxide. All liv-\n\ning things contain C-14. Plants naturally\nabsorb it during photosynthesis, and\nhumans and animals consume the plants.\nThe intake of C-14 ends when a living\norganism dies, and the amount of C-14\nin the organic material starts to break\ndown. Because the breakdown happens\nat a known rate, measuring the remain-\ning amount of C-14 makes it possible to\npinpoint the date at which the organism\ndied. The abbreviation BP (before pres-\nent) refers to the year 1950, an arbitrary\ndate used in calculating C-14 dates, for\n\nthe “present” is always changing. °°\n''"

The first was “Life in a Multi-\nCultural Society: Egypt from Cambyses to Constantine and Beyond,” which was\nscheduled so as to transition into an international congress on demotic studies, thus\nemphasizing the inextricable relationship between culture and language.

Rather than look at the symbols or scenes of the bodyfield as independent\nmotifs or vignettes, we will consider the design of Romano-Egyptian mummies as\na whole in an effort to understand the significance of the decoration of red-shroud\nportrait mummies. Our goal is to identify a “focal meaning”® for these fascinating\ntestaments to the human desire to outwit eternity.\n\nThe earliest attempt to “read” the imagery on portrait mummies used a method\nthat seemed to work with success when applied to the interpretation of some narrative\nscenes from temple and tomb walls: from bottom to top. This approach had worked\nfor the Epigraphic Survey of the University of Chicago in reading the registers on the\nnorth exterior wall of the temple at Karnak, for it is only in that sequence that the\nwars of Seti 1 appear in proper chronological order.’** Similar success in interpret-\ning scenes, from bottom to top, was achieved with reading the walls of Room x11 of\nthe Old Kingdom mastaba’” of Mereruka.’® That novel approach to “reading” por-\ntrait mummies produced some interesting complementary patterns. It also had the\npleasing result of climaxing at the top of the figure, focusing the reader’s gaze on the\nmesmerizing depiction in the mummy portrait of the deceased. Although the bottom-\nto-top approach was not universally accepted by scholars,\" it was never considered\nto be dogmatic. The registers could, of course, be considered from a more traditional\ndirection—top to bottom. In fact, the flexibility to read the images successfully in\none direction or the other might perhaps even be seen to illustrate the complemen-\ntary cycles of time as understood by the ancient Egyptians.” The ancient Egyptians\nviewed time from two perspectives, as nhh (cyclical time) and as djet (linear time).\nNhh encompassed recurrent events such as the daily cycle of the sun, or the monthly\ncycle of the moon, or the annual flood of the Nile. NAA also embodied a sense of time-\nlessness such as one might experience regarding the events that occur in a mythic\ncycle. In djet, events had a fixed beginning and end, such as those that begin and end\nan actual historical account. The complementary nature of the two aspects of time is\nmade clear by the fact that we translate both nhh and djet into English as “forever.”\nWhen these two words appear together at the end of a religious statement r nhh r djet,\nwe translate the phrase as “forever and ever,” a colloquialism we still use in modern\ntimes although, to us, having lost its reference to a dualistic time frame, it appears to\nbe a redundant and antiquated idiom.\n\nThe complementary nature of the pictoral scenes that illustrate ancient Egyp-\ntian funerary events can be seen as existing within both cyclical and linear time.\nThe imagery can depict the actual events of the purification, mummification, and\ntransfiguration of the deceased mortal into an akh, the third form of the Egyptian\n“soul”—a shimmering beam of sunlight, a transfigured spirit that lives among the\nimmortals—as well as to reference both the solar and the Osirian myths of resurrec-\ntion upon which rested a mortal’s hopes for resurrection. In linear time, the imagery\nwould reference the actual events of the purification, mummification, and transfig-\n''"

Whereas some methods\nseem to work in some contexts, one method does not work in every context. This is\nfrustratingly true, however, whether we are looking at scene registers on coffins or on\ntemple or tomb walls. Challenged by the cinematic technique of showing scenes as\n“flashbacks” and the omission of germane scenes, some scholars have suggested that\nthe ancient Egyptians purposely avoided a sequential narrative in order to engage the\ninitiated viewers in the plot.’”? Others have emphasized that the ancient Egyptians\nmight purposely have placed scenes in nonsequential order in an attempt to protect\nthe focal meaning from being easily read, keeping sacred knowledge safe from those\nwho were uninitiated. Others view the fluidity of scenes as a benefit so that myths\n“can be drawn upon depending on the context and function of their use... and more\nthan one myth may be mobilized for the same purpose.”\n\nThe seeming inconsistences or contradictions that result were therefore an inten-\ntional creation of the ancient Egyptians. They offered endlessly flexible readings to an\naudience from a community of people who engaged in a thought process coined the\n“multiplicity of approaches”—the acceptance of seemingly contradictory solutions to\na single problem.” The ancient Egyptians, after all, recognized at least three versions\nof the origin of the universe, each connected with a propagandistic intention tied to\nthe city associated with the account: Heliopolis, Hermopolis, or Memphis.’” The point\nis that the very flexibility for the potential of complementary readings emphasizes the\ncomplexity of thought of these ancient people and the tremendous freedom—within\na limited repertoire—that Egyptian artists, and presumably their patrons, exercised.\n\nThe phenomenon of a seemingly random selection and sequence of scenes that\noccurs in the funerary art of mastaba tombs has been addressed by the Leiden Mas-\ntaba Project (Mastabase),”* with respect to the selection and arrangement of scenes in\nthe mastabas of the Old Kingdom at Giza and Sakkara. The aim of that project was to\nregister through computer graphics the type and placement of the “daily life” scenes\nin Old Kingdom mastabas in order to establish statistical data from which one might\ndraw conclusions about the frequency (i.e., popularity) of scenes or the relationship of\n''"

The results of the project confirmed that\nwhat might make for a brilliant interpretation for one mastaba might not work for the\none next to it. What might at first appear to have been a rare motif was shown to be\ncommon, or vice versa. The overarching conclusion one might draw from surveying\nthe results of the Mastabase could be summarized as a reinforcement of the capricious\nnature of motif and placement selection in Old Kingdom mastabas with one excep-\ntion: the necessity for the inclusion of an offering scene within the decorative program\nof any mastaba. Therefore, the answer to the question of whether or not, in the artistic\nrepertoire of ancient Egyptian funerary art, there was flexibility or a strict and limited\nprogram, is both yes and no. We can be assured that the ancient Egyptians would have\nliked that answer. The most cogent interpretation of the selection and layout of scenes,\nwhether on coffins, tombs, or temple walls, is that they were defined by a complex\ninterplay of parallelism, antithesis, and chiasmus.””\n\nThe Meaning of Red. One of the first questions that springs to mind when categorizing\nthe red-shroud group is, “Why red?” Why, specifically, was the color red selected as\nthe overall or background color for these mummies? After all, the choice of color in\nthe decoration of a mummy, as in every decision made in the funerary process, was\nnot arbitrary. A basic tenet of this study is that there is significance to the selection\nof each motif and an overall unity to the decorative program of each mummy, for\nindividual motifs and their combination in conjunction with cultic utterances and\ntexts are the magical means for achieving immortality. As with any magical spell,\nthe desired outcome depends on the proper ingredients added in the proper propor-\ntions and sequence. The answer to the question, “Why red?” can be arrived at only\nafter careful consideration of the multivalent meanings of the color—an investigative\nprocess that acknowledges the concept of the “multiplicity of approaches,” which pro-\nvided a flexible framework for how the ancient Egyptians perceived the workings of\nthe universe. Not surprisingly then, in ancient Egypt, the color red had both positive\nand negative connotations.\"*° It was the color of the “Red Land,” the dangerous and\nuninhabitable desert. Red ink was used to mark dangerous passages in texts.\" Red\nwas also the color associated with the murderous god Seth. Yet, as the color of life-\nsustaining blood, red had an invigorating and positive aspect as well. Moreover, red\nwas associated with the sun god, Re, as he rose triumphantly each morning, bloodied\nfrom his nightly battle with Apophis, the god of chaos. This provides the link to the\ncolor red in a mortuary context. “Through sympathetic magic, the identification of the\nwrapped mummy with the blood-stained body of the sun-god would secure for the\ndeceased a successful solar deliverance from destructive powers,” perpetuating an\nendless cycle of rebirth and resurrection. In ancient Egypt, the gods were thought to\nhave had bones of silver, flesh of gold, and hair of lapis lazuli. The scintillating aspect\nof gold, red, and resin with relation to the sun and the rebirth of the deceased are\ndiscussed below.\n''"

We must establish precise descriptions of the\nmotifs that appear on portrait mummies and document the location and placement\nof these motifs within the overall decorative program of these mummies. Thus, the\ndescription and documentation of the individual motifs, arranged in pseudoregisters\non the bodyfield of the mummy of Herakleides (see pp. 23-27), constituted only a first\nstep in understanding the selection and meaning of these motifs. To establish a corpus\nfor an iconographic study of the red-shroud portrait mummies, we must first identify\nthe criteria for the designated category. The use of the color red for funerary wrappings\nhas a long tradition. The earliest examples of bodies wrapped in red shrouds date to\npredynastic burials in Nubia, and the earliest definitively identified dyed cloth from\npharaonic Egypt is a red-dyed fragment from Meidum that dates to the late Third or\nearly Fourth Dynasty (ca. 2600-2500 B.c.).\"** The German nomenclature rotgrundig\n(red-ground) can be used as a general designation for mummies wrapped in cloth\nwith a red background.” The red coloring does not always cover the entire textile in\nwhich the mummy is wrapped; sometimes the cloth is completely dyed, sometimes\nthe red color is painted over a stucco layer, and sometimes the red coloring appears\nonly on the sides of the shroud.\n\nThe Getty Red-Shroud Study Group of nine mummies (see chart 1), seven of\nwhich were sampled in order to analyze their red pigment, was selected based solely\non their similarities in manufacturing technique and therefore included only those\nred-shroud portrait mummies with portraits on wooden panels. The following icon-\nographic discussion will consider red-shroud mummies regardless of the matrix—\nshroud or stucco—used in their construction and whether or not the portrait was\npainted on a wooden panel or directly onto the shroud. The first step in this pre-\nliminary attempt to document motifs that appear on red-shroud portrait mummies—\nwithout regard to manufacture techniques—is to divide the red-shroud group into\ntwo categories based on design:\n\n¢ Category 1: mummies whose bodyfield continues from the portrait as if the\nindividual were wearing street dress\n\n¢ Category 2: mummies whose bodyfield is divided into horizontal registers.\nThis category can be further subdivided into:\n2A the “simple type,” that is, horizontal registers with large motifs, and\n2B the “complex type,” that is, horizontal registers containing complex\nvignettes to which additional elements such as horseshoe-shaped frames or\ndetachable footcases have been added\n''"

The scene of the mummy\non the bier with a kite above had its origins in the story of the conception of Horus\nwhen Isis, in the form of a bird, hovered over the reconstructed body of her murdered,\nbut revivified husband, Osiris. Variants of the image of a creature hovering above a\nmummy can include either an avian (kite or ba bird) or bovine (ram or bull), as on\nCoptic Museum inv. 4124 or on a stucco mummy in the Egyptian Museum, Cairo\n(inv. prov. 17/10/16/1), a previously unprovenienced piece that Bierbrier has now shown\nto have been excavated at Fag el-Gamus.\"® Because the lower arms and hands are\npainted both on the mummy of Dioskoros and on the red-shroud portrait mummy in\nBasel, these two are distinctive in combining features of both category 1 (daily dress)\nand category 2 (horizontal registers). In this manner they resemble mummies such as\nCairo CG 33216 (fig. 1c) or Manchester inv. 1767 (fig. 46c), which are either completely\nmolded in stucco or have a stucco upper half or bust joined to a red-ground shroud.\nSuch combinations of manufacturing techniques illustrate the breadth of styles of\ndecoration for mummies that were contemporary with the red-shroud portrait mum-\nmies. These variations are useful also for establishing dating parameters for all three\ncategories of portrait mummies, for they can be used to construct a system of seria-\ntion, or sequence dating, based on style, that can be used in conjunction with the dates\narrived at through more objective systems of dating such as those discussed above.\n\nWe could perhaps, therefore, add Dioskoros to category 2B (the complex group),\nlisted in chart 4, which at present consists of Artemidoros, BM EA 21810; Thermoutha-\nrin, Cairo, CG 33221; and two other mummies in Cairo, CG 33220 and CG 33219 (fig.\n48). Of the motifs noted above that appear on category 2A mummies, the most frequent\ncomplex vignettes with multiple figures are (1) a scene of Anubis with the mummy on\na bier, and (2) an offering scene or the depiction of altars.\n\nThe conclusion of the Mastabase—that the most prevalent, and perhaps most\nsignificant, motif on the walls of mastaba tombs of the Old Kingdom was the offering\nscene—is still relevant to the Romano-Egyptian portrait mummies manufactured at\nthe end of Egyptian civilization, almost twenty-five hundred years later. The difference\nis that in the Old Kingdom the offerings were made for the benefit of the deceased,\nwhile in the Roman era the offerings were made for the benefit of the gods. One can\nonly speculate that the emphasis on appeasing the divine in the Roman period is a\nreflection of underlying and growing fears and concerns about the efficacy of the\npower of the Egyptian gods to ensure stability in a changing world.\n\nA trio of mummies, excavated by Flinders Petrie at Hawara in 1888, presents an\ninteresting test case for category 2B of the red-shroud portrait mummy group. Found\ntogether, the mummies are now in three different museums (fig. 49). These three red-\nshroud mummies with stiffened stucco casings have mythological motifs molded in\nrelief and arranged in horizontal registers. Although they are of similar manufacture,\nManchester 1775 (Artemidoros) belongs to category 2A, the simple type of this group,\n''"

Each has the name of the deceased and a funerary epithet\n(Eupsuxei, “farewell”) modeled across the chest. The position of this information on the\nupper chest and the color of the mummies recall the description in the second- (or third-)\ncentury-A.D. letter from a woman to her brother, explaining that he will be able to iden-\ntify the mummy of their mother that was being shipped to him because her name was\nwritten “above the abdominal cavity” and the mummy was painted “the color of roses.”°\n\nBecause they were found in a common grave and two of them share a common\nname, Petrie presumed the Hawara trio to have been a family group. He seemed to\nenjoy assigning groups of mummies to families with, unfortunately, very little defini-\ntive evidence. He did note, however, that the three mummies were “similarly dec-\norated.”' They are indeed, with the exception that the bodyfields of the two males\n(both named Artemidoros) are painted red, and that of the female (Thermoutharin),\nhot pink. They are not, however, identical as was later overstated.’ The scenes on\nManchester 1775 of category 2A are without any parallel on the other two, and if we\nlook carefully, there are subtle details that distinguish the British Museum example\nfrom the one in Cairo, although both are from category 2B. As practice for document-\ning the motifs and symbols on red-shroud portrait mummies, let us now look very\ncarefully at the decorative programs of these two (BM EA 21810 and CG 33221).\n\nThe many disparities one can note in chart 5 between two objects that appeared\nat first glance to be identical indicate the individuality of artists despite the fact that\nthey worked within a limited repertoire and under the greatest restrictions. The varia-\ntions also served to engage the artist, patron, and viewer's intelligence, imagination,\nand familiarity with the range of possibilities.\n\nThe narrative motifs on red-shroud portrait mummies from category 2B that\ndo not appear on category 2A mummies include: a barque scene; the “Baptism of\nPharaoh”; a procession of standard bearers; and the weighing-of-the-heart judgment\nscene. Category 2B mummies can also exhibit a bead-net pattern and a detachable,\ndecorated cartonnage footcase.\n\nOnly close, personal observation and the careful documentation of motifs will\nlead to the correct identification of details that may prove to be significant. Moreover,\nas the Leiden Mastabase has shown, the collection of data in charts and graphs can\nhelp establish the frequency of motifs and their variants. The results provide evidence\nfor sanctioned variations within standardized scenes or can confirm the continuity of\nmotifs from the iconographic repertoire of the pharaonic period into the Roman era.\n\nThe documentation of motifs on the red-shroud portrait mummies indicates a\ndistillation of the Egyptian theology of resurrection into a limited number of icono-\ngraphic elements. However, as with the myths these motifs were based on, the aim in\nall likelihood was not to provide a strict sense of narrative coherence but rather “to\namass as many potentially beneficial associations for the deceased as possible‘ from\nwithin that limited repertoire. If we look now for antecedents for these motifs, we will\nfind them on the cultic elements that were placed closest to the bodies of mummies\n''"

Over “a plain shroud of faded red linen”’® is a net of blue\ncylinder beads strung in a rhombic pattern. The motifs here are simple indeed: a large\nwinged scarab; two small faience scarabs, one incised with the figure of a standing\ngoddess with a papyrus scepter; the Four Sons of Horus; and two vertical bands for\ntexts, left blank. Here the interesting point is that elements made of faience and gold\nare added to the bead net.\n\nDating to the early Ptolemaic era (after 323 B.c.), the cartonnage suite of the\nmummy of a woman named Diptah (fig. 5ob) covers “a plain shroud of faded linen,\nperhaps originally red in color in view of traces under the foot cover.”” The carton-\nnage cover incorporates the following motifs: a winged human-headed ba; a wesekh\ncollar with falcon terminals; the winged, kneeling figure of the goddess Nut flanked by\nwadjet eyes; a mummy on a bier flanked by the Four Sons of Horus; squatting demons;\nAnubis with the mummy on a bier; the tyet (knot) amulet of Isis flanked by squatting\ndemons; and a U-shaped twine-and-petal pattern.’* The text on an accompanying\nhypocephalus invokes the deities Osiris, Sokar-Osiris, Isis, Nephthys, and the Four\nSons of Horus.\n\nArtists and patrons of the Romano-Egyptian portrait mummies were operating\nwithin a repertoire of motifs and cult references that had a long tradition in funerary\nart—one that can be shown to have had precedents in earlier eras, the late Rames-\nside period, the Third Intermediate period, and the Ptolemaic period. This is most\nstartlingly demonstrated by the decorated mummy of a boy (fig. 50c).'\"? Although the\nmummy was purchased on the art market, and its decorative coverings have been\nacknowledged to consist of variously dated pieces that were assembled for maximum\nsaleability, the piece unconsciously exhibits the quintessential hallmarks of Romano-\nEgyptian mortuary art. Antecedents for the openwork cartonnage panel are from the\nThird Intermediate period. Examples contemporary with it come from excavations at\nRoman Douch. The coverings present such a dizzying series of cells overlying a Ptol-\nemaic cartonnage panel that one’s eyes must adjust before successfully decoding its three\nsalient images: a wesekh collar, the winged figure of Nut, and Anubis administering to\nthe mummy on a bier.”\n\nIn addition to the presentation of three significant motifs for resurrection, the\nopenwork cover is gold. We noted that the bead coverlet of Ankhhor (see fig. 50a) was\nmade of blue faience and gold. The word for faience in ancient Egyptian is tjehent,\nmeaning “dazzling,” the final element deemed necessary for resurrection.\n\nThe last of the red-shroud portrait mummies to be discussed here is in the col-\nlection of the Karanis Museum, Kom Oshim, at Fayum and was excavated at the\nnearby site of Deir el-Banat in the Fayum (figs. 51a, b).*°”\" Although it has been sug-\ngested by a personal letter from one of the early British excavators of Roman sites in\nthe Fayum’” that there were others like it, this portrait mummy is still unique in a\nnumber of ways. First, the portrait is drawn in ink on a sheet of papyrus; and, second,\nalthough the body appears at first to have no noticeable body decoration at all, it was\n''"

The ancient Egyptians would,\nhave appreciated this approach as “complementary,” that is, a balance that occurs when |\ntwo opposite (but equal) parts are necessary in order to create a whole. The concept of\ncomplementary thought was expressed by the ancient Egyptians in their explanation of |\nthe creation of the universe.\n\nAccording to the Heliopolitan theogony, the world was brought into being by a\npreexistent Monad who created the first cosmic deities differentiated by gender as male\nand female. This idea of balance or harmony was personified as the goddess Maat. It is\njust such a symbiotic balance—here between science and the humanities—that offers\nthe greatest hope for unlocking the mysteries of the past.\n\nThe investigation of the Romano-Egyptian, red-shroud portrait mummy Her-\nakleides began with a minor conservation treatment. What evolved was an in-depth,\ncooperative, multidisciplinary discussion of funerary practices and life in Roman Egypt.\n\nScientific techniques such as CT scanning provided a nondestructive look inside\nthe wrappings of Herakleides. Multispectral imaging enabled the previously illegible\ninscription on the exterior of the footcase to be read. Scientific analyses of organic and\ninorganic materials helped to understand the well-chosen balsams and pigments used for\nmummification and their special preservative properties. Parallels established between\nthis study group and the greater red-shroud category documented how techniques of\nmanufacture and elements of iconography were shared. All groups were shown to link\ntogether through the use of the symbolic, powerful, and protective aspects of their red\ncolor, and the generous use of gold and resin.\n\nData gleaned from this study of the mummy of Herakleides include:\n\n¢ Restoration of the inscription following the name Herakleides, written on the\nfootcase of the mummy. ‘The text, revealed under enhanced imaging, has been inter-\npreted as the name of the father (Thermos) or, more likely, the mother (Thermouthis or\nThermoutharion) of the deceased.\n\n« Age at death—early twenties—determined by a study of his well-preserved\nbones and teeth, which corroborates the appearance of the young man in the portrait.\n''"

Considering the Egyptian habit of recycling textiles for\nmummy wrappings, this date is compatible with a date of manufacture of the mummy\nin the early second century a.p., the date that had previously been suggested based on\nstylistic criteria.\n\n¢ Identification of lime wood as the species of imported wood used for the por-\ntrait panel.\n\n¢ Determination that the red pigment used to paint the shroud came from Rio\nTinto in southwestern Spain.\n\n¢ Identification of what is not inside the wrappings: no jewelry, heart scarabs, or\nfigural amulets.\n\n¢ Identification of inclusion within the wrappings of a wooden embalming\nboard, an enigmatic bundle of linen containing at least five small objects, and a mum-\nmified ibis.\n\nIn addition, the study includes:\n\n¢ Discussion of the iconography on the shroud of Herakleides and a compari-\nson of the popularity and frequency of the use of these motifs on other Romano-Egyp-\ntian red-shroud portrait mummies. The motifs are shown to have been selected from a\nlimited repertoire descended from the decoration of pharaonic mummies dating to the\nThird Intermediate Period, and even those of the New Kingdom, some twelve hundred\nyears earlier. The specific arrangement of the motifs on the body are shown to conform\nto a proscribed order, but artists were also allowed freedom to introduce or adapt details.\n\n¢ Identification and analysis of the motifs and techniques of manufacture of the\nunprovenienced mummy of Herakleides. Specific features, including the use of gold\nleaf rhomboids around the portrait frame and division of the motifs into pseudo-reg-\nisters, indicate that the mummy of Herkleides was manufactured at either Hawara or\nel-Hibeh. Further research is needed to identify the locations of specific workshops for\nthe production of portrait mummies.\n\n« Discussion of the possible religidus meaning behind the inclusion of the\nmummified ibis. The search for an explanation behind the inclusion of animals with\nthe burials of humans in ancient Egypt is in its initial stages and the rare situation of\nHerakleides mummy calls attention to the significance of a phenomenon that requires\nfurther attention. Whether the animals were specifically selected for their association\nwith the profession of the deceased (as scribes or priests of the gods associated with\nthose animals) or were intended as votive offerings of animals (ibises, falcons and dogs)\nto the gods (Thoth, Horus and Anubis) most influential in the determination of the final\njudgment are two possibilities suggested here that bear further investigation.\n''"

As with any multidisciplinary research, the answers\nwill require the expertise and contributions of many investigators, which is how this\nproject took shape and the only way in which it will continue. It also requires a large\nbody of comparative data acquired from similar investigations in order to draw verifi-\nable conclusions and to establish parallels. It is our hope that this study of Herakleides\nwill inspire and provide direction for future studies on the Romano-Egyptian mummies.\n''"

The pigments were analyzed to assess how the material was made and where it\nmay have come from (i.e., Egypt or elsewhere in the Roman world). The overarching\ngoal was to understand the early Roman history of pigment mining and preparation,\nto establish trade patterns of these materials, and to document the use of red-lead pig-\nment as part of the Romano-Egyptian funerary palette.\n\nTwo analytical techniques were employed: inductively coupled plasma time-\nof-flight mass spectrometry (ICP-TOFMS) was used to obtain a detailed elemental\nand isotopic analysis, and Raman microspectroscopy was used to establish major and\ntrace mineralogical phases in the red-lead pigment. Since Raman microspectroscopy\ncan characterize single pigment grains, it is an effective tool to assess minor miner-\nalogical phases that might otherwise be below the detection limits of conventional\nmineral identification techniques such as powder x-ray diffraction.\n\nVisual inspection of a sample of red pigment from Herakleides shows that the\nparticles are polygonal in shape and on the order of 1-3 mm in size. The particles are\ndispersed within the original medium, which is identified by gas chromatography-\nmass spectrometry (GCMS) as beeswax. These large particle sizes suggest the pigment\nwas ground after production. Subtle color differences can be seen among the particles.\nSome of the particles appear red-yellow, while others are more intensely red.\n\nSamples of red pigment from each of the seven red-shroud mummies in this\nstudy were composed primarily of lead (83%-92% by weight), with significant traces\nof tin (Sn) as well as elevated levels of trace elements such as silver (Ag), gold (Au),\ncadmium (Cd), indium (In), antimony (Sb), and bismuth (Bi). Strong compositional\nsimilarity among all samples suggests they originated from a single source.\n\nThe high levels of these trace elements within a lead matrix are consistent with\nlitharge (PbO), in which trace metals associated with an ore body become enriched\nduring silver refinement (known as cupellation), as opposed to an unprocessed native\nlead ore. The elevated silver and gold content suggests the parent lead-ore source\nwould have been rich enough in these metals to be exploited for its metallurgical con-\ntent. The metallurgical associations of the material are further underpinned by the\nabundant presence of tin. In a typical geologic deposit of lead, tin is not present, due\nto its geochemical incompatibility with lead ores (i.e., galenas, cerrusites, and angle-\nsites). Therefore, tin can only enter into lead through nonnatural routes (i.e., process-\ning of ores).\n''"

By\ncomparing ratios of these individual lead isotopes to the ratios from known geologi-\ncal sources of lead, the provenance of the lead can be determined. Therefore, to fur-\nther assess the possibility that the lead in the red pigments came from metallurgical\nprocessing of a silver- or gold-bearing ore, lead-isotope ratios in the pigments were\nmeasured and compared to known isotopic values associated with lead-ore bodies\nthroughout the Mediterranean and Near East, including Egypt. The closest matches\nwere lead-rich slags, silver, and other smelting debris from mining and metal refine-\nment at the early Roman site of Rio Tinto in Spain.\n\nMolecular characterization of all seven samples was undertaken by Raman\nmicrospectroscopy to explore whether the slight color differences observed among\nthe particles within the samples were an optical effect or corresponded to different\nchemical species. In all samples, the major phase was confirmed to be red lead (Pb,O.).\nRaman spectra from an area containing yellow as well as red particles indicate the\npresence of lead stannate (Pb,SnO, ) together with red lead. The discovery of lead stan-\nnate was somewhat surprising as this material does not occur in nature but is pro-\nduced by heating mixtures of lead and tin oxides to temperatures between 650° C and\n800° C, with the final color depending on temperature.** Significantly, lead stannate\nwas not known to have been produced for use as a pigment until the fourteenth cen-\ntury A.D. when it was called lead-tin yellow. Lead stannate was detected together with\nred lead in all of the red pigment samples examined in this study.\n\nConclusion\n\nTrace-element and lead-isotope data point to silver production at Rio Tinto,\nSpain, as the source of the red-lead pigment. The trace-element data—in particular the\ndetection of elevated levels of tin—point to litharge formed during cupellation of sil-\nver as the likely immediate precursor of the pigment material. The discovery that the\ntin is present in the form of lead stannate provides additional evidence that litharge\nwas reheated to produce the red-lead pigment used on the mummies.\n\nFinding red-lead pigment on Romano-Egyptian mummies points to trade in\neither pigments or raw litharge between Spain and Egypt during this period and may\nfurther suggest that this group of seven red-shroud mummies may have been pre-\npared in the same ancient workshop.\n\nMarc Walton\nAssociate Scientist\nGetty Conservation Institute\n\n \n\n* This text is based on Marc S.

Paul Getty Museum, is the subject of a comprehensive\n\nanalysis that arose from a collaboration between Getty\nconservators and specialists in disciplines as diverse ;\nas Egyptology, radiology, and conservation science.\nEmploying state-of-the-art technology, the project\nteam, without unwrapping the mummy, answered\nnumerous questions about the person within the linen |\nbandages. Does the haunting painted portrait over the io\nmummy’s face actually depict this young man? Are\nthere precious jewels or amulets within the wrappings?\nWhat materials were used in the mummification? Can\nwe scientifically date the mummy?\n\nThe authors also explore the social context of\nthe practice of artificial mummification, which began\nin Egypt over five thousand years ago. The motifs\ndecorating Herakleides’ red-painted shroud represent ! P\ngods and goddesses as well as a desire for an eternal\nafterlife—beliefs associated with the Egypt of the\npharaohs but shown here to have maintained their vital\ninfluence into the time of the Roman Empire. The book\nconcludes with a comparison of the Getty mummy with\nothers of like genre from museums worldwide.\n\nLorelei H.
