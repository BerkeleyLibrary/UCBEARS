If numerous inventors have advocated retting by water at the best temper-
ature, few attempted to solve the problem of drying the straw industrially.
Schenk, whose system was introduced into Ireland in 1847, dried in the
open air in summer; and in winter in a shed holding the straw between a pair
of rods like the reeds of a loom.
Nearer home, Messrs. De Swarte & Doumer, in their patent No. 245,752,
dried the retted straw without moving it, and by ventilation, in the same closed
tank in which it had been retted.
Parsy's patent (175-597) describes a series of wagons passing through
heated rooms, but none of them dries as thoroughly or as cheaply as Mr. Feuil-
º thanks to the double action of centrifugal hydro-extraction and ventilation
y hot air.
If the process we are examining is ingenious, if it yields useful products of
good quality, is it capable in practice of being carried out industrially?

In using the data furnished by the experimental station we can lay down the
conditions under which would operate an establishment capable of retting,
drying and scutching 5 tons of rippled dry straw per day, say 1,500 tons per
annull Il.
