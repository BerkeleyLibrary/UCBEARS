# NOTE: Date/Time#to_s(format) in Rails views reads time/date formats from config/locales, but
#       in test code it reads from Date/Time::DATE_FORMATS, so we need to make sure it's in both
#       places. Presumably there's some better way this is supposed to work? At least this code
#       makes sure it's consistent.

# TODO: Figure out how this is *really* supposed to work
